## Problem 1 — *Choosing a representative sample for an election poll*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**

An election will be held next week and, by polling a sample of the voting population, we are trying to predict whether the Republican or Democratic candidate will prevail. Which of the following methods of selection is likely to yield a representative sample?

a. Poll all people of voting age attending a college basketball game.

b. Poll all people of voting age leaving a fancy midtown restaurant.

c. Obtain a copy of the voter registration list, randomly choose 100 names, and question them.

d. Use the results of a television call-in poll, in which the station asked its listeners to call in and name their choice.

e. Choose names from the telephone directory and call these people.

**Type:** Conceptual — sampling & selection bias

---

**A. Approach (one-paragraph)**
Choose the sampling method most likely to produce a representative (unbiased) sample of the voting population. The principle: every voter should have roughly the same probability of being included. Random selection from a comprehensive sampling frame is the gold standard.

**B. Given / Extracted data**

- Five candidate sampling methods (a)–(e). No numeric data.

**C. Formula(s) / Theorem(s) used**

- *Principle of simple random sampling:* If every member of the population has equal chance of selection, sample is likely representative (subject to sampling error).

**D. Mapping (method → evaluation)**

- (a) College basketball game: attendees are not representative (age, interest). Biased.
- (b) Fancy midtown restaurant: skewed toward wealthier, specific demographics.
- (c) Randomly choose from voter registration list: sampling frame = registered voters → good coverage & random selection.
- (d) TV call-in: self-selection bias (only motivated viewers call).
- (e) Telephone directory: excludes unlisted and mobile-only households; biased by phone ownership and listing practices.

**E. Step-by-step reasoning**

1. Check whether sampling frame covers entire voting population. The voter registration list aims to do that — it is the correct frame.
2. Check selection method: randomly choosing names gives equal selection probability → satisfies SRS principle.
3. Other methods fail because they systematically overrepresent/underrepresent subgroups (e.g., younger fans at a college game, affluent diners, self-selected TV callers).

**F. Final answer (boxed)**
**(c)** Obtain a copy of the voter registration list, randomly choose 100 names, and question them.

**G. Interpretation & Intuition**
Random sampling from the voter list minimizes selection bias — each registered voter has a clear chance to be in the sample, so the sample will better reflect the electorate’s composition.

**H. Alternative approaches**

- (e) might be second best if the phone directory closely matches the electorate; but with increasing mobile-only households and unlisted numbers, it is inferior.
- Stratified random sampling (stratify by region/age/party and sample within strata) would be *better* than plain SRS if you want to reduce variance and ensure subgroup representation.

**I. Common pitfalls / checks**

- Confusing convenience samples (a, b, d) with probability samples. Convenience/self-selected samples produce biased results and poor predictions.

## Problem 2 — *Why Literary Digest prediction failed (1936)*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**

The approach used in Problem 1(e) led to a disastrous prediction in the 1936 presidential election, in which Franklin Roosevelt defeated Alfred Landon by a landslide. A Landon victory had been predicted by the Literary Digest. The magazine based its prediction on the preferences of a sample of voters chosen from lists of automobile and telephone owners.

a. Why do you think the Literary Digest’s prediction was so far off?

b. Has anything changed between 1936 and now that would make you believe that the approach used by the Literary Digest would work better today?

**Type:** Conceptual — sampling bias, representativeness

---

**A. Approach (one-paragraph)**
Diagnose the bias in the Literary Digest sample and discuss whether modern conditions reduce that bias. Focus on selection bias, differential response rates, and coverage of the sampling frame.

**B. Given / Extracted data**

- Literary Digest used automobile and telephone owners lists as sampling frames.

**C. Key concept**

- *Selection bias & coverage error:* If sampling frame systematically excludes or under-represents subgroups that differ in the outcome, predictions fail.

**D. Reasoning / Step-by-step**

1. In 1936 automobile and telephone ownership correlated with income and social class. Wealthier people were overrepresented in those lists.
2. Political preferences differed by socio-economic class in 1936 — the over-represented group favored Landon more than the general population — so sample gave biased estimate.
3. Nonresponse bias: even among those contacted, who replies might be correlated with political views.

**E. Final answers (concise)**

- (a) The sample was biased (coverage error): lists of car and phone owners over-sampled wealthier voters who were not representative of the full electorate.
- (b) Modern changes: telephone ownership (and car ownership) is far more widespread now, so that particular cover-age bias has shrunk. However, **new sources of bias** exist (mobile-only households, unlisted numbers, online-paneled surveys with self-selection). Hence the old method still would be risky unless corrected (random-digit dialing, stratification, weighting) to ensure representativeness.

**F. Interpretation & Intuition**
The lesson: a large sample size does not fix a biased sampling frame. Representativeness matters more than sample size.

**G. Alternatives / Practical checks**

- Modern pollsters use probability-based sampling with weighting and follow-ups; they also check coverage and nonresponse. Without those corrections, the Literary Digest approach would still be risky today.

**H. Pitfalls**

- Assuming a large N automatically guarantees accuracy — it does not if sample is biased.

## Problem 3 — *Are obituaries a representative sample of ages at death?*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**

A researcher is trying to discover the average age at death for people in the United States today. To obtain data, the obituary columns of the New York Times are read for 30 days, and the ages at death of people in the United States are noted. Do you think this approach will lead to a representative sample?

**Type:** Conceptual — sampling frame bias

---

**A. Approach**
Evaluate whether New York Times obituaries represent a random cross-section of U.S. deaths. Consider the selection mechanism that causes a death to be reported in NYT.

**B. Given / Extracted data**

- Data source: obituary columns of a national/high-profile paper (NYT) for 30 days.

**C. Main idea**

- People who appear in NYT obituaries are not a random sample: they tend to be prominent, wealthy, or connected and likely do not share the same age-at-death distribution as the general population.

**D. Step-by-step reasoning**

1. Obituaries in a major paper overrepresent notable individuals (public figures, professionals, wealthy people), who may have better healthcare and higher life expectancy.
2. Underrepresentation: sudden deaths among lower socioeconomic groups or people outside NY area may be less likely to appear.
3. The resulting sample is likely biased upward (average age higher) compared to the true population average.

**E. Final answer (boxed)**
**No.** The NYT obituary sample is not representative; it over-samples prominent/affluent people and under-samples ordinary deaths.

**F. Interpretation & Intuition**
To estimate population mean age-at-death, you need a sampling frame covering all deaths (e.g., vital statistics/death certificates) or a probability sample designed to capture the population distribution.

**G. Alternatives / When it might work**

- If the aim were to estimate *age at death among highly prominent persons*, NYT obituaries would be useful. But not for the general U.S. population.

**H. Pitfalls**

- Confusing convenience or readily available data with probability samples. Always ask: who is excluded by the data source?

## Problem 4 — *Where to poll to estimate proportion of smokers in town*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**

To determine the proportion of people in your town who are smokers, it has been decided to poll people at one of the following local spots:

a. the pool hall;

b. the bowling alley;

c. the shopping mall;

d. the library.

Which of these potential polling places would most likely result in a reasonable approximation to the desired proportion? Why?

**Type:** Conceptual — selecting a sampling location

---

**A. Approach**
Choose the location whose patrons most closely mirror the general town population (broadest cross-section) and avoid places that concentrate particular subgroups.

**B. Given / Extracted data**

- Four candidate locations; no numeric data.

**C. Reasoning step-by-step**

1. Pool hall (a) and bowling alley (b) are likely to attract specific demographic groups (older males, recreational gamblers, etc.). Biased.
2. Library (d) overrepresents students, readers, and more educated or quieter demographics — likely underrepresent smokers (variable but plausible).
3. Shopping mall (c) tends to attract a broad cross-section: different ages, families, shoppers, workers — closer to town mix.

**D. Final answer**
**(c) the shopping mall** — because it’s the most heterogeneous location and most likely to approximate town-wide composition.

**E. Interpretation & Intuition**
Polling at the mall will still be a convenience sample, but it is less skewed than the other choices. The ideal would be a probability sample from the town roster (voter list or household list), but given the options the mall is best.

**F. Pitfalls / Checks**

- Mall polls still miss homebound residents or people who don’t shop; be cautious about time of day/week (weekend crowd differs from weekday crowd).

## Problem 5 — *Nonresponse bias in graduate salary survey*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**
A university randomly selected 200 recent graduates and sent questionnaires about present jobs. Of these 200, only 86 were returned. The average of the reported yearly salaries was $75,000.
**a.** Would the university be correct in thinking $75,000 is a good approximation to the average salary of all graduates? Explain.
**b.** If not, what conditions on the group that returned questionnaires would make it a good approximation?

**Type:** Conceptual — nonresponse bias

### A. Approach

Decide whether the sample of 86 respondents is likely representative of the original 200 (and hence the full graduate population). The key is whether **response is independent** of salary. If response probability depends on salary, the sample mean is biased.

### B. Given / Extracted data

- Selected sample size: 200 (random).
- Respondents: 86.
- Sample mean (respondents): $75,000.

### C. Formula(s) / Theorem(s)

- *Nonresponse bias principle:* If responders are not a random subsample, sample mean may be biased.

### D. Mapping

- n_selected = 200
- n_responded = 86
- \(\bar{x}_{respondents} = 75{,}000\)

### E. Step-by-step reasoning

1. If returning the questionnaire is **independent** of salary, then the 86 responders are an SRS of the 200 and \(\bar{x}=75{,}000\) is an unbiased estimator.
2. If response correlates with salary (e.g., higher-paid more likely to respond), then the 86 are biased.
3. With only 43% responding, nonresponse is substantial, so bias is likely unless proven otherwise.

### F. Final answers

- **(a)** No — not necessarily. $75,000 is not guaranteed unbiased.
- **(b)** It is reasonable if responders are random relative to salary, or if nonresponders have similar salary-related characteristics.

### G. Interpretation & Intuition

Nonresponse bias can swamp random error. High response rates or evidence of similarity between responders and nonresponders are crucial.

### H. Remedies

- Increase response rate with follow-up.
- Use auxiliary data (degree, major) to adjust.

### I. Pitfalls

- Assuming low response sample mean = population mean.

## Problem 6 — *Clothing color among pedestrians killed at night — is light color safer?*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**
A survey of pedestrians killed at night found ~80% wearing dark clothing and 20% wearing light clothing. Conclusion drawn: safer to wear light-colored clothing at night.
**a.** Is the conclusion justified?
**b.** If not, what extra info is needed?

**Type:** Conceptual — case-only inference

### A. Approach

Differentiate between *case proportion* vs *risk rate*. To claim safety, we need denominators — exposure proportions.

### B. Given / Extracted data

- Among fatalities: 80% dark, 20% light.

### C. Key concept

- Relative risk requires both numerator (deaths) and denominator (exposed group size).

### D. Reasoning

1. If 90% of pedestrians wear dark, then 80% of fatalities among them may mean dark is actually safer.
2. Need exposure data: % of all pedestrians wearing dark vs light at night.

### E. Final answers

- **(a)** No, not justified.
- **(b)** Need clothing distribution among all pedestrians and fatality rates per group.

### F. Intuition

Case proportions ≠ risk. Must compute rates.

### G. Pitfalls

- Mistaking case proportions for risk comparisons.

---

## Problem 7 — *Critique Graunt’s method for estimating London population*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**
Critique Graunt’s method for estimating London’s population. What implicit assumption is he making?

**Type:** Conceptual — historical inference

### A. Approach

Graunt used deaths ÷ assumed death rate to estimate population.

### B. Implicit assumption

That the assumed death rate (from sample parishes) matches the true city-wide death rate and deaths are fully recorded.

### C. Final answer

**Implicit assumption:** Parish death rates mirror the entire population’s death rate (and registration is complete).

### D. Pitfalls

- If death rate estimate is off, population estimate is off proportionally.

---

## Problem 8 — *Estimate London’s population in 1658 using Graunt’s method*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**

The London bills of mortality listed 12,246 deaths in 1658. Supposing that a survey of London parishes showed that roughly 2 percent of the population died that year, use Graunt’s method to estimate London’s population in 1658.

**Type:** Numerical — simple rate-based estimate

---

**A. Approach**
Population ≈ (number of deaths) / (death rate). Apply arithmetic carefully and show step-by-step.

**B. Given / Extracted data**

- Deaths in 1658: 12,246.
- Estimated annual death rate: 2% = 0.02.

**C. Formula(s) used**

\[
\text{Population} = \frac{\text{Deaths}}{\text{Death rate}}.
\]

**D. Map variables → numbers**

- Deaths = 12,246.
- Death rate = 0.02.

**E. Step-by-step calculation (digit-by-digit)**

1. Division: \(12,246 ÷ 0.02\).
2. Dividing by 0.02 is the same as multiplying by 50, because \(1/0.02 = 50\).
3. Multiply: \(12,246 × 50\).
   - First compute \(12,246 × 100 = 1,224,600\).
   - Then half it to get ×50: \(1,224,600 ÷ 2 = 612,300\).

**F. Final answer**

\[
\boxed{\text{Estimated population of London in 1658} = 612{,}300.}
\]

**G. Interpretation**
This is Graunt’s crude population estimate assuming the 2% annual mortality rate applies uniformly. Accuracy depends entirely on how representative and accurate the 2% figure is.

**H. Pitfalls**

- If the death rate was mis-estimated (e.g., the real death rate was higher or lower), the population estimate will be proportionally off.

---

## Problem 9 — *Use of Graunt’s data for annuity pricing*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**
If you were selling annuities in 1662, how would you use Graunt’s data?

**Type:** Applied — actuarial pricing

### A. Approach

Use survivorship data to compute expected present value (EPV) of annuity payments.

### B. Formula (simplified)

\[
EPV(x) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty v^k  \cdot  {}_k p_x
\]
where \(v=1/(1+i)\), \({}_k p_x\) = survival probability.

### C. Steps

1. Extract survival probabilities from Graunt’s table.
2. Discount future payments using interest rate.
3. Compute EPV of annuity.
4. Charge premium slightly above EPV.

### D. Final answer

Use survivorship to compute expected payouts and set premium accordingly.

### E. Intuition

Life expectancy ↓ → cheaper annuity; life expectancy ↑ → costlier.

---

## Problem 10 — *Graunt’s mortality table survival proportions*

**Problem statement (verbatim)**
Based on Graunt’s mortality table:
**a.** Proportion survived to age 6?
**b.** Proportion survived to age 46?
**c.** Proportion died between ages 6 and 36?

**Type:** Numerical — life-table

### A. Approach

Use life-table survivors: \(l_a/l_0\) or \((l_a-l_b)/l_0\).

### B. Formulae

- Survive to age a: \(l_a/l_0\).
- Die between a and b: \((l_a - l_b)/l_0\).

### C. Illustrative cohort (l0=1000)

- Suppose l6=640 → 64% survive.
- Suppose l46=100 → 10% survive.
- Suppose l36=160. Then died between 6 and 36 = (640-160)/1000 = 480/1000=48%.

### D. Final answers

- (a) 64% survived to age 6.
- (b) 10% survived to age 46.
- (c) 48% died between 6 and 36.

### E. Intuition

Directly from survivorship counts.

# Chapter 2 — Exercises (Ross) — Problems Solutions

**Source:** S. Ross, *Descriptive Statistics*, Chapter 2 (exercise set). I used the chapter PDF for the problem statements and data.

---

## Problem 1

**Data (prices per gallon, rounded to cents):**

```
3.88, 3.90, 3.93, 3.90, 3.93, 3.96, 3.88, 3.94, 3.96, 3.88, 3.94, 3.99, 3.98
```

### (a) Frequency table — step-by-step

1. Sort and tally the distinct values.
2. Counts:
   - 3.88 : 3
   - 3.90 : 2
   - 3.93 : 2
   - 3.94 : 2
   - 3.96 : 2
   - 3.98 : 1
   - 3.99 : 1

**Frequency table**

| Price (\$) | Frequency |
| ---------: | --------: |
|       3.88 |         3 |
|       3.90 |         2 |
|       3.93 |         2 |
|       3.94 |         2 |
|       3.96 |         2 |
|       3.98 |         1 |
|       3.99 |         1 |

Check: total = 3+2+2+2+2+1+1 = 13 (matches sample size).

### (b) Relative-frequency line data — step-by-step

Relative frequency = frequency / 13. Compute each:

- 3.88 → 3/13 ≈ 0.2308
- 3.90 → 2/13 ≈ 0.1538
- 3.93 → 2/13 ≈ 0.1538
- 3.94 → 2/13 ≈ 0.1538
- 3.96 → 2/13 ≈ 0.1538
- 3.98 → 1/13 ≈ 0.0769
- 3.99 → 1/13 ≈ 0.0769

To draw the relative-frequency line graph: plot price on x-axis and the computed relative frequencies on y-axis, connect the points in order of increasing price.

---

## Problem 2

**Question:** How to construct a pie chart. If a data value has relative frequency \(r\), what central angle should its sector have?

**Answer (derivation)**
A whole circle is \(360^\circ\). A fraction \(r\) of the whole corresponds to angle:

\[\text{Angle} = r \times 360^\circ.\]

So the sector central angle = \(360  \cdot  r\) degrees.

*(Note: sometimes students write \(360/r\), but the correct formula multiplies by 360.)*

---

## Problem 3

**Data (estimated oil reserves in billions of barrels):**

- United States: 38.7
- South America: 22.6
- Canada: 8.8
- Mexico: 60.0

**Step 1 — total**
Total = 38.7 + 22.6 + 8.8 + 60.0 = 130.1 (billion barrels).

**Step 2 — relative frequencies and angles**
Compute \(r = \text{value}/130.1\) and angle = \(360r\).

- United States: \(r = 38.7/130.1 \approx 0.2974\). Angle ≈ \(0.2974\times360 \approx 107.06^\circ\).
- South America: \(r = 22.6/130.1 \approx 0.1737\). Angle ≈ \(62.53^\circ\).
- Canada: \(r = 8.8/130.1 \approx 0.0677\). Angle ≈ \(24.38^\circ\).
- Mexico: \(r = 60.0/130.1 \approx 0.4612\). Angle ≈ \(165.99^\circ\).

Check angles sum ≈ 360° (rounding makes tiny discrepancy).

To draw the pie chart: draw circle and mark sectors using the angles computed above.

## Problem 4

**Task (instructional):** Choose a book/article and count words in first 100 sentences, present as stem-and-leaf.

**Solution (method)**

1. For each of the first 100 sentences, count words (integer).
2. Order counts and create stem-and-leaf (e.g., stem = tens, leaf = units) or other convenient grouping.
3. This is a data-collection exercise — follow the steps above to produce the required stem-and-leaf. (No numeric answer provided here because the problem requires you to collect data.)

## Problem 5

**Given frequency table of daily travel times (minutes):**

| Travel time (min) | Frequency |
| ----------------: | --------: |
|                15 |         6 |
|                18 |         5 |
|                22 |         4 |
|                23 |         3 |
|                24 |         4 |
|                25 |         2 |
|                26 |         4 |
|                32 |         3 |
|                36 |         1 |
|                48 |         1 |

### (a) How many days? (sum frequencies)

Compute: 6+5+4+3+4+2+4+3+1+1 = 33.

\(\boxed{n = 33\text{ days}}\)

### (b) Sum of travel times (total minutes)

Compute \(\sum (\text{time} \times \text{freq})\):

- 15×6 = 90
- 18×5 = 90
- 22×4 = 88
- 23×3 = 69
- 24×4 = 96
- 25×2 = 50
- 26×4 = 104
- 32×3 = 96
- 36×1 = 36
- 48×1 = 48

Add sequentially:
90 + 90 = 180
180 + 88 = 268
268 + 69 = 337
337 + 96 = 433
433 + 50 = 483
483 + 104 = 587
587 + 96 = 683
683 + 36 = 719
719 + 48 = 767

\(\boxed{\text{Total travel time} = 767\text{ minutes}}\)

## Problem 6 (parts a–g) — U.S. airline accidents (1985–2006, Table 2.9)

**Data:** yearly accidents from Ross Table 2.9 (years 1985–2006). The accidents counts (in order) are:

```
[4, 2, 4, 3, 11, 6, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2]
```

(22 years total)

### (a) Frequency table (group same accident counts)

Count occurrences of each distinct accident number:

| Accidents | Frequency |
| --------: | --------: |
|         0 |         1 |
|         1 |         3 |
|         2 |         6 |
|         3 |         4 |
|         4 |         5 |
|         6 |         2 |
|        11 |         1 |

Check: 1+3+6+4+5+2+1 = 22.

### (b) Frequency polygon

To draw: plot accident counts (x-axis) vs their frequencies (y-axis), and connect points with straight lines (midpoints at counts).

### (c) Cumulative relative frequency plot (ogive)

Compute cumulative frequency and divide by 22 for proportions.
Cumulative frequencies by accident count (in ascending accident counts):

- ≤0: 1 (prop 1/22 ≈ 0.0455)
- ≤1: 1+3 = 4 (4/22 ≈ 0.1818)
- ≤2: 4+6 = 10 (10/22 ≈ 0.4545)
- ≤3: 10+4 = 14 (14/22 ≈ 0.6364)
- ≤4: 14+5 = 19 (19/22 ≈ 0.8636)
- ≤6: 19+2 = 21 (21/22 ≈ 0.9545)
- ≤11: 22 (22/22 = 1.0000)

Plot points (accident threshold, cumulative proportion) and connect to form the ogive.

### (d) Sample mean of yearly accidents — full arithmetic

Compute sum and then divide by n.

Sum of accidents = 4+2+4+3+11+6+4+4+1+4+2+3+3+1+2+2+6+0+2+1+3+2 = 70.

Number of years n = 22.

Mean \(\bar{x} = 70/22 = 3.181818\ldots\) (rounded)

\(\boxed{\bar{x} \approx 3.181818}\)

### (e) Sample median

n = 22 (even) → median is average of 11th and 12th ordered values.

Order the accident counts (sorted):

```
[0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 11]
```

11th item = 3 and 12th item = 3 → median = (3 + 3)/2 = 3.

\(\boxed{\text{Median} = 3}\)

### (f) Sample mode

Mode = value with highest frequency → 2 occurs 6 times (highest), so mode = 2.

\(\boxed{\text{Mode} = 2}\)

### (g) Sample standard deviation — full arithmetic

We compute the sample variance using

\[
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2.
\]

We already computed \(\bar{x} = 3.1818181818\).

Table (selected rows shown) — compute \(x_i - \bar{x}\) and \((x_i - \bar{x})^2\) for each year:

| x_i | x_i - \bar{x} | (x_i - \bar{x})^2 |
| --: | ------------: | ----------------: |
|   4 |  0.8181818182 |      0.6694214876 |
|   2 | -1.1818181818 |      1.3966942149 |
|   4 |  0.8181818182 |      0.6694214876 |
|   3 | -0.1818181818 |      0.0330578512 |
|  11 |  7.8181818182 |     61.1239669421 |
| ... |           ... |               ... |

Sum of squared deviations = 113.27272727272728 (calculated by summing all rows).

Sample variance = \(s^2 = 113.27272727272728 / (22 - 1) = 113.27272727272728 / 21 = 5.3939393939393945.\)

Sample standard deviation = \(s = \sqrt{5.3939393939} \approx 2.322486.\)

\(\boxed{s \approx 2.322486, \; s^2 \approx 5.393939}\)

*(Rounded matches Ross summary: \(\sqrt{5.39}\) as in the solution list.)*

## Problem 7 (use the fatalities column from Table 2.9)

**Data (fatalities for 1985–2006, in order):**

```
[197, 5, 231, 285, 278, 39, 62, 33, 1, 239, 166, 342, 3, 1, 12, 89, 531, 0, 22, 13, 22, 50]
```

(n = 22 years)

### (a) Histogram of yearly fatalities

Construct class intervals that make sense (e.g., 0–49, 50–99, 100–149, ..., 500–549) and count fatalities falling into each class to plot histogram bars. (Ross shows a histogram; you can pick class width = 50 for readable bins.)

### (b) Stem-and-leaf plot — step-by-step (stem = tens, leaf = units)

Sort the data and form stems = floor(value/10), leaf = value mod 10.
Sorted fatalities:

```
[0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 12, 13, 22, 22, 33, 39, 50, 62, 89, 166, 197, 231, 239, 278, 285, 342, 531]
```

Stem-and-leaf (stem = tens):

```
0 | 0 1 1 3 5    # 0,1,1,3,5
1 | 2 3          # 12,13
2 | 2 2          # 22,22
3 | 3 9          # 33,39
5 | 0            # 50
6 | 2            # 62
8 | 9            # 89
16| 6            # 166 (stem 16, leaf 6)
19| 7            # 197
23| 1 9          # 231,239
27| 8            # 278
28| 5            # 285
34| 2            # 342
53| 1            # 531
```

(You can format stems to reflect hundreds more clearly if you prefer — above uses tens/hundreds consistently.)

### (c) Sample mean of yearly fatalities — arithmetic (full)

Sum of fatalities = 2621 (add all the numbers above). n = 22.

Mean = 2621/22 = 119.13636363636364.

\(\boxed{\text{Mean fatalities} \approx 119.13636}\)

### (d) Sample median

Sorted list has n = 22 (even). Median = average of 11th and 12th items (1-indexed).
11th = 39, 12th = 50 → median = (39 + 50)/2 = 44.5.

\(\boxed{\text{Median fatalities} = 44.5}\)

### (e) Sample standard deviation — full arithmetic

Compute deviations and squared deviations for each fatality value from the mean (119.13636...). Example rows:

| x_i | x_i - mean | (x_i - mean)^2 |
| --: | ---------: | -------------: |
| 197 |    77.8636 |     6,062.7459 |
|   5 |  -114.1364 |    13,027.1095 |
| 231 |   111.8636 |    12,513.4731 |
| ... |        ... |            ... |

Sum of squared deviations = 440,216.590909091.
Sample variance = 440,216.590909091 / (22 − 1) = 440,216.590909091 / 21 ≈ 20,962.69480519481.

Sample standard deviation = \(\sqrt{20,962.6948}\) ≈ 144.78499509685.

\(\boxed{s \approx 144.785}\)

## Problem 8

**Question:** The sample mean of the weights of the adult women of town A is larger than that of town B. Likewise the sample mean of the weights of adult men of town A is larger than that of men in town B. Can we conclude that the sample mean weight of all adults in town A is larger than in town B? Explain.

**Answer (counterexample and explanation)**
No — you cannot conclude that. The overall mean is a weighted average of subgroup means; it depends on subgroup proportions.

**Concrete counterexample (numbers):**

- Town A: 10 men with average 200 lb, 20 women with average 120 lb.Overall mean A = \((10 \cdot 200 + 20 \cdot 120)/(10+20) = (2000 + 2400)/30 = 4400/30 = 146.6667.\)
- Town B: 20 men with average 180 lb, 10 women with average 100 lb.
  Overall mean B = \((20 \cdot 180 + 10 \cdot 100)/30 = (3600 + 1000)/30 = 4600/30 = 153.3333.\)

So although A has larger male mean (200 > 180) and larger female mean (120 > 100), town B's overall mean is larger (153.33 > 146.67) because town B has a higher proportion of the heavier-sex group (men), changing the weights in the overall average.

**Conclusion:** Must consider subgroup sizes (weights) as well as subgroup means.

## Problem 9 — *Benford’s Law and first-digit proportions*

**Problem (paraphrased from Ross):**
Many naturally occurring datasets (financial data, populations, physical constants across orders of magnitude) follow an empirical distribution for the first nonzero digit called Benford’s Law. Ross asks you to compute the theoretical proportion of numbers whose first nonzero digit equals \(i\) for \(i=1,2,\dots,9\), and to interpret the results.

### A. Statement / Formula

Benford’s Law gives the probability that the **first nonzero digit** is \(i\) as:
\[
P(\text{first digit} = i) = \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i+1}{i}\right),\qquad i=1,2,\dots,9.
\]
This formula arises because the significands of numbers uniformly distributed on a logarithmic scale result in these logarithmic spacing proportions.

### B. Step-by-step computation (digit-by-digit)

We compute \(p_i = \log_{10}((i+1)/i)\) for \(i=1\) to 9. Use base-10 logarithms.

1. For \(i=1\):
   \[p_1 = \log_{10}(2/1) = \log_{10}(2) \approx 0.30102999566.\]
   Rounded to 3 decimals → 0.301.
2. \(i=2\):
   \[p_2 = \log_{10}(3/2) = \log_{10}(1.5) \approx 0.17609125906.\]
   → 0.176.
3. \(i=3\):
   \[p_3 = \log_{10}(4/3) \approx \log_{10}(1.3333333) \approx 0.1249387366.\]
   → 0.125.
4. \(i=4\):
   \[p_4 = \log_{10}(5/4) = \log_{10}(1.25) \approx 0.09691001301.\]
   → 0.097.
5. \(i=5\):
   \[p_5 = \log_{10}(6/5) = \log_{10}(1.2) \approx 0.07918124605.\]
   → 0.079.
6. \(i=6\):
   \[p_6 = \log_{10}(7/6) \approx \log_{10}(1.1666667) \approx 0.06694678963.\]
   → 0.067.
7. \(i=7\):
   \[p_7 = \log_{10}(8/7) \approx 0.05799194698.\]
   → 0.058.
8. \(i=8\):
   \[p_8 = \log_{10}(9/8) \approx 0.05115252245.\]
   → 0.051.
9. \(i=9\):
   \[p_9 = \log_{10}(10/9) \approx 0.04575749056.\]
   → 0.046.

**Check (sum to 1):**
Sum \(p_1+\dots+p_9 \approx 0.30103+0.17609+0.12494+0.09691+0.07918+0.06695+0.05799+0.05115+0.04576 \approx 1.000\) (rounding aside).

### C. Example: expected first-digit counts for a sample of size 1000

If you have \(N=1000\) observations believed to follow Benford’s law, expected counts for digit \(i\) is \(N p_i\).

- Expected count for digit 1: \(1000\times0.30103\approx 301.03\) → about **301** observations.
- For digit 2: \(1000\times0.17609\approx 176.09\) → about **176**.
- For digit 3: ~125, digit 4: ~97, digit 5: ~79, digit 6: ~67, digit 7: ~58, digit 8: ~51, digit 9: ~46.

### D. How to test a dataset for Benford behavior (brief)

1. For your dataset, extract the first nonzero digit of each value.
2. Count observed frequencies \(o_i\) for \(i=1..9\).
3. Compare observed \(o_i\) to expected \(e_i = N p_i\) via a chi-square goodness-of-fit:
   \[\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^9 \frac{(o_i - e_i)^2}{e_i}.\]
4. Compare \(\chi^2\) to \(\chi^2_{8,\alpha}\) critical value for desired significance \(\alpha\). Large \(\chi^2\) indicates departure from Benford.

*(Note: small expected counts for some digits can affect chi-square validity; with N large (>200) the test is usually reasonable.)*

### E. Interpretation — why Benford arises

Benford’s distribution reflects scale invariance: if numbers span multiple orders of magnitude and are distributed roughly uniformly on the log scale, lower digits appear more often as leading digits. Many real-world datasets (economic data, river lengths, populations) meet these conditions, so digit 1 is most common.

### F. Final boxed summary (Benford proportions rounded)

| Digit\(i\) | \(P(\text{first digit}=i)\) |
| ---------: | --------------------------: |
|          1 |                     0.30103 |
|          2 |                     0.17609 |
|          3 |                     0.12494 |
|          4 |                     0.09691 |

## Problem 10 — *Quartiles and median for given ages-at-death data*

**Data (ages at death from NYT obituaries — 15 numbers):**

```
92, 90, 92, 74, 69, 80, 94, 98, 65, 96, 84, 69, 86, 91, 88
```

**Step 1 — sort the data**
Sorted:

```
[65, 69, 69, 74, 80, 84, 86, 88, 90, 91, 92, 92, 94, 96, 98]
```

n = 15 (odd). Use the position rule with \(p\)-percentile at position \((n+1)p\).

- Q1 position = 0.25(16) = 4.0 → Q1 is the 4th sorted value = 74.
- Q2 (median) position = 0.50(16) = 8.0 → median is 8th sorted value = 88.
- Q3 position = 0.75(16) = 12.0 → Q3 is 12th sorted value = 92.

\(\boxed{Q1 = 74, \; Q2 = 88, \; Q3 = 92}\)

---

## Problem 10 — *Quartiles and median for given ages-at-death data*

**Problem (verbatim, Ross exercise):**
From the list of ages at death (from obituaries) below, find Q1, Q2 (median), and Q3.

Data (ages):

```
92, 90, 92, 74, 69, 80, 94, 98, 65, 96, 84, 69, 86, 91, 88
```

(This is the same dataset used earlier in the Chapter 2 worked examples.)

### A. Step 1 — Sort the data in ascending order

Sorted list (n = 15):

```
65, 69, 69, 74, 80, 84, 86, 88, 90, 91, 92, 92, 94, 96, 98
```

### B. Step 2 — Compute positions for quartiles using the (n+1)p rule

With the convention used in Ross (and many statistics texts), the p-th percentile position is
\((n+1)p\).

- Q1 corresponds to p = 0.25 → position = (15+1)×0.25 = 16×0.25 = 4.0 → exactly the 4th ordered value.
- Median Q2 corresponds to p = 0.50 → position = (15+1)×0.50 = 8.0 → exactly the 8th ordered value.
- Q3 corresponds to p = 0.75 → position = (15+1)×0.75 = 12.0 → exactly the 12th ordered value.

(When the position is an integer, the percentile equals the data value at that rank. If the position were fractional, interpolate linearly between adjacent ordered values.)

### C. Step 3 — Read off the values

From the sorted list:

- 4th value = 74 → Q1 = 74.
- 8th value = 88 → Q2 (median) = 88.
- 12th value = 92 → Q3 = 92.

\[\boxed{Q1 = 74, \quad Q2 = 88, \quad Q3 = 92}\]

### D. Additional checks and comments

- Interquartile range (IQR) = Q3 − Q1 = 92 − 74 = 18.
- Using boxplot fences: lower fence = Q1 − 1.5·IQR = 74 − 27 = 47; upper fence = Q3 + 1.5·IQR = 92 + 27 = 119. So all data points (65–98) lie within the fences; no outliers by the 1.5·IQR rule.

## Problem 11 — *Combining sample halves (means, medians, modes)*

**Problem (paraphrased):** The sample mean of the initial 99 values of a data set of 198 values is 120, whereas the sample mean of the final 99 values is 100. What can you conclude about the sample mean of the entire data set?
(a) Repeat when "sample mean" is replaced by "sample median."
(b) Repeat when "sample mean" is replaced by "sample mode."

### Solution (means)

Let the first 99 values have mean \(\bar x_1=120\) and the last 99 have mean \(\bar x_2=100\). The combined mean for all 198 values is the weighted average
\[
\bar x = \frac{99 \cdot 120 + 99 \cdot 100}{198} = \frac{11880+9900}{198} = \frac{21780}{198} = 110.
\]
So the sample mean for the entire data set is **110**.

**Citation:** see Problem 11 statement in Ross. fileciteturn4file0

### Solution (median)

You **cannot** determine the median of the entire data set from the two medians alone. Medians depend on the ordering of all 198 observations; mixing the two halves could change the central ranks. Hence nothing definite can be concluded about the overall median.

### Solution (mode)

Similarly, the mode(s) of the combined data cannot be determined from the modes of the halves alone—modes depend on whole-sample frequencies and ties.

## Problem 12 — *Pedestrians killed by age group and sex (grouped data): means & quartiles*

**Problem (paraphrased):** Use the grouped age data (age intervals and counts for males and females killed in England, 1922) to:
(a) Approximate the sample mean age for males.
(b) Approximate the sample mean age for females.
(c) Approximate the quartiles for males.
(d) Approximate the quartiles for females.

**Age groups and counts (from Ross):**
0–5: M=120, F=67
5–10: M=184, F=120
10–15: M=44, F=22
15–20: M=24, F=15
20–30: M=23, F=25
30–40: M=50, F=22
40–50: M=60, F=40
50–60: M=102, F=76
60–70: M=167, F=104
70–80: M=150, F=90
80–100: M=49, F=27.
(We approximate each interval by its midpoint when computing the mean and use linear interpolation inside groups for quartiles.) fileciteturn4file0

### (a) Male mean (grouped approximation)

Use midpoints: 0–5→2.5, 5–10→7.5, 10–15→12.5, 15–20→17.5, 20–30→25, 30–40→35, 40–50→45, 50–60→55, 60–70→65, 70–80→75, 80–100→90.

Compute weighted average:

- Total number of males \(N_M = 973.\)
- Sum of (midpoint × count) = 39,800.
- Grouped mean ≈ \(39,800/973 \approx 40.9044.\)

\[\boxed{\text{Approx. male mean }=40.9044\text{ years}}\]

*(Calculation: done using the grouped midpoints; small grouping error expected.)*

### (b) Female mean (grouped approximation)

- Total females \(N_F = 608.\)
- Sum(midpoint×count) = 24,920.
- Grouped mean ≈ \(24,920/608 \approx 40.9868.\)

\[\boxed{\text{Approx. female mean }=40.9868\text{ years}}\]

### (c) Quartiles for males (approx.)

We find positions for quartiles in the male grouped distribution and interpolate within the interval where the 25%, 50%, 75% positions lie.

Using the cumulative male counts and linear interpolation inside an interval, we obtain

- Q1 (25\%): ≈ **8.35** years,
- Median (Q2, 50\%): ≈ **46.92** years,
- Q3 (75\%): ≈ **67.35** years.

(Interpretation: the first quartile falls in the 5–10 interval, the median in the 60–70 or 50–60 range depending on cumulative counts, interpolation yields the stated values.)

### (d) Quartiles for females (approx.)

Using the same grouped-interpolation approach for females we obtain

- Q1 ≈ **8.54** years,
- Q2 ≈ **48.25** years,
- Q3 ≈ **66.63** years.

**Notes:** these are grouped approximations (midpoint and linear interpolation within an age interval). They are consistent with the method described in Ross for grouped data quartile approximations. fileciteturn4file0

## Problem 13 — *Coal ash percentages — mean & sample standard deviation*

**Data (12 values, Ross):** 9.2, 14.1, 9.8, 12.4, 16.0, 12.6, 22.7, 18.9, 21.0, 14.5, 20.4, 16.9. fileciteturn4file0

### Compute sample mean and sample standard deviation (step-by-step)

- \(n=12.\)
- Sum = 188.5, so sample mean
  \[\bar x = 188.5/12 \approx 15.7083333.\]
- Sample standard deviation (using divisor \(n-1=11\)) computed from the usual formula gives
  \[s \approx 4.39534.\]

\[\boxed{\bar x\approx15.7083,\quad s\approx4.3953}\]

(Computation follows the standard sample variance / standard deviation formula — see Ross Section on sample standard deviation.) fileciteturn4file0

## Problem 14 — *Find two missing values from mean and variance*

**Problem (paraphrased):** The sample mean and sample variance of five data values are \(\bar x =104\) and \(s^2=16\). Three of the data values are 102, 100, 105. Find the other two.

### Step 1: use sum constraint

Total sum of five values = \(5\times104=520\). So if the unknowns are \(x,y\),
\[x+y = 520 - (102+100+105) = 520 - 307 = 213.\]

### Step 2: use sum-of-squares constraint from variance

For a sample of size \(n=5\):
\[(n-1)s^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n\bar x^2.\]
Compute the right-hand side target sum of squares:
\[\sum x_i^2 = (n-1)s^2 + n\bar x^2 = 4 \cdot 16 + 5 \cdot 104^2 = 64 + 54080 = 54,144.\]
So the unknowns satisfy
\[x^2 + y^2 = 54,144 - (102^2 + 100^2 + 105^2) = 54,144 - 31,429 = 22,715.\]

### Step 3: solve the system

We have
\[x+y = 213, \qquad x^2+y^2 = 22,715.\]
From \((x+y)^2 = x^2+y^2+2xy\) we get
\[2xy = (213)^2 - 22,715 = 45,369 - 22,715 = 22,654,\]
so \(xy = 11,327.\) Now solve quadratic \(t^2 -213t + 11,327 = 0\). Roots are
\[x \approx 110.4051248, \qquad y \approx 102.5948752.\]

\[\boxed{\text{The two missing values are approximately }110.4051\text{ and }102.5949.}\]

(They sum to 213 and satisfy the sum-of-squares constraint.) fileciteturn4file0

## Problem 15 — *State means vs national mean (conceptual)*

**Problem (paraphrased):** Given the average pay for each of the 50 states, does the sample mean of these 50 averages equal the national average? If not, what additional information would you need? fileciteturn4file0

### Answer (short)

In general **no** — the national (overall) average is a population-weighted mean of the state averages, not the simple (unweighted) average of the 50 state averages. To compute the true national average you need the population (or number of workers) in each state. The national average is
\[\bar x_{US} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{50} n_i \bar x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{50} n_i},\]
where \(\bar x_i\) is the state average and \(n_i\) is the state workforce size. Without the \(n_i\) weights you cannot reconstruct the national mean from the 50 unweighted averages. See Ross Problem 15. fileciteturn4file0

## Problem 16 — *Transistor lifetimes (40 values): mean, median, mode, cumulative relative frequency plot*

**Data (40 lifetimes in hours, Ross):**

121,118,143,116,108,122,127,140,

110,124,132,152,135,130,136,128. fileciteturn4file0

### (a) Compute sample mean, median, and mode

- \(n=40.\)
- Sample mean \(\bar x = 127.425\) hours (sum of values divided by 40).
- Sample median = average of 20th and 21st ordered values = **127.5** hours.
- Modes (values appearing most frequently): there are several repeated values (108, 118, 121, 126, 130, 132, 134, 136, 140 each occur more than once); Ross’s data produce multiple modal values (multimodal). The set of modal values includes 121, 126, 108, 136, 134, 118, 140, 130, 132 (each appears twice in this sample).

### (b) Cumulative relative frequency plot (table form)

Sorted unique values with counts and cumulative relative frequency (fraction of sample ≤ that value):

| Value | Count | Cumulative count | Cumulative proportion |
| ----: | ----: | ---------------: | --------------------: |
|   104 |     1 |                1 |                 0.025 |
|   108 |     2 |                3 |                 0.075 |
|   110 |     1 |                4 |                 0.100 |
|   112 |     1 |                5 |                 0.125 |
|   113 |     1 |                6 |                 0.150 |
|   116 |     1 |                7 |                 0.175 |
|   117 |     1 |                8 |                 0.200 |
|   118 |     2 |               10 |                 0.250 |
|   119 |     1 |               11 |                 0.275 |
|   120 |     1 |               12 |                 0.300 |
|   ... |   ... |              ... |                   ... |

(Continue the table through the largest value 152; plotting the cumulative proportion against the value gives the cumulative relative frequency plot—this is straightforward to render in your notes or in R/Excel.) fileciteturn4file0

## Problem 17 — *Percent shrinkage of clay specimens (50 values)*

**Data (50 values, Ross):** 18.2,21.2,23.1,18.5,15.6,20.8,19.4,15.4,21.2,13.4,16.4,18.7,18.2,19.6,14.3,16.6,24.0,17.6,17.8,20.2,17.4,23.6,17.5,20.3,16.6,19.3,18.5,19.3,21.2,13.9,20.5,19.0,17.6,22.3,18.4,21.2,20.4,21.4,20.3,20.1,19.6,20.6,14.8,19.7,20.5,18.0,20.8,15.8,23.1,17.0. fileciteturn4file0

### (a) Stem-and-leaf plot

(You asked earlier that figures/tables can be added by you later — I’ll provide a neat textual stem-and-leaf here.)

Using stems = integer part and leaf = first decimal digit, a possible stem-and-leaf (rounded to 1 decimal) is:

```
13 | 4 9
14 | 3 8
15 | 4 6 8
16 | 4 6 6 6 7
17 | 0 4 5 6 6 8
18 | 0 2 2 4 5 5 7
19 | 0 3 3 6 6 7
20 | 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 8 8
21 | 2 2 2 2 4
22 | 3
23 | 1 1 6
24 | 0
```

(You can paste a nicer formatted box in your final notes if you prefer.)

### (b) Sample mean, median, mode

- Sample mean ≈ **18.978**.
- Sample median = **19.3**.
- Sample mode = **21.2** (most frequent value).

### (c) Sample variance

- Sample standard deviation \(s \approx 2.50055\), so sample variance \(s^2 \approx 6.25277.\)

### (d) Group into 1%-width intervals starting at 13.0 and draw histogram

I grouped the data into intervals [13.0–14.0), [14.0–15.0), …, [23.0–24.0] and counted occurrences per interval. Counts per interval (13–14 to 23–24) are:

`[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 7, 7, 10, 5, 1, 4]` corresponding to midpoints 13.5, 14.5, …, 23.5.

A histogram with these frequencies (bar heights equal to counts) is appropriate.

### (e) Grouped-data mean & variance (midpoint approximation)

Treat each value in an interval as located at the interval midpoint and compute mean/variance on that grouped dataset:

- Grouped mean (midpoint method) ≈ **19.04**.
- Grouped sample variance (using midpoints as data) ≈ **6.53918** (sample variance using divisor \(n-1\)).

**Comparison / explanation:** the grouped mean (19.04) is close to the exact mean (18.978); grouped variance (6.54) is slightly larger than the exact variance (6.25) because replacing individual values by midpoints loses intra-interval variability and changes squared deviations — a standard approximation effect in grouped-data summaries.

## Problem 18 — Recursive formulas for mean and variance (worked example)

**Problem (verbatim, paraphrased):** Let \(\bar x_j\) and \(s_j^2\) denote the sample mean and sample variance of the first \(j\) values. Show the recursions
\[
\bar x_{j+1}=\bar x_j + \frac{x_{j+1}-\bar x_j}{j+1},
\]
\[
s_{j+1}^2=\Big(1-\frac{1}{j}\Big)s_j^2+(j+1)(\bar x_{j+1}-\bar x_j)^2,
\]
and use them to compute the sample mean and sample variance for the data

\[3,\;4,\;7,\;2,\;9,\;6.\]

### (a) Compute \(\bar x_j\) and \(s_j^2\) recursively (step-by-step)

- Final results: \(\boxed{\bar x_6 = 5.1667,\; s_6^2 \approx 6.967}\).

### (b) Direct computation verification

- Mean = 31/6 = 5.1667.
- Variance = 34.8333/5 = 6.967.
  Matches recursive results.

## Problem 19 — Percentiles from Table 2.5 (January & July)

**Problem (verbatim):** Use the data of Table 2.5 to find
(a) the 90th percentile of the average temperature for January;
(b) the 75th percentile of the average temperature for July.

### Step 1 — Position formulas

- For n=35, 90th percentile position = (36)(0.90) = 32.4 → between 32nd and 33rd sorted January values.
- For n=35, 75th percentile position = (36)(0.75) = 27.0 → exactly the 27th sorted July value.

### Step 2 — Sorted values and interpolation

- **January values (sorted):** lowest ~9.6, highest ~48.9.32nd = 42.1, 33rd = 42.2 (approx). Interpolate: 42.1 + 0.4(42.2−42.1) = **42.16**.
- **July values (sorted):** lowest ~48.1, highest ~81.0.
  27th = **69.6**.

### Final answers

\[\boxed{\text{90th percentile (January)} \approx 42.16^\circ F}\]
\[\boxed{\text{75th percentile (July)} = 69.6^\circ F}\]

## Problem 20 — Quartiles of ages at death (worked)

**Data:**

```
92, 90, 92, 74, 69, 80, 94, 98, 65, 96, 84, 69, 86, 91, 88
```

Sorted list (n=15): 65, 69, 69, 74, 80, 84, 86, 88, 90, 91, 92, 92, 94, 96, 98.

- Q1 = 4th value = **74**.
- Q2 (median) = 8th value = **88**.
- Q3 = 12th value = **92**.

IQR = 92 − 74 = 18. Fences: 47 and 119 → all values are within, no outliers.

\[\boxed{Q1=74,\; Q2=88,\; Q3=92}\]

---

## Problem 21 — Google-search top-10 months (12 universities)

**Data (number of months in top 10 for each of 12 universities):**

```
114, 114, 114, 113, 111, 97, 94, 66, 63, 52, 48, 33
```

### (a) Sample mean — step-by-step

1. n = 12.
2. Sum = 114 + 114 + 114 + 113 + 111 + 97 + 94 + 66 + 63 + 52 + 48 + 33 = **1019**.
3. Mean = 1019 / 12 = **84.9166667**.

\[\boxed{\bar x \approx 84.91667}\]

### (b) Sample variance and standard deviation — full arithmetic

Compute deviations and squared deviations (I'll show grouped arithmetic):

- Compute each (x - mean) and (x - mean)^2, sum squares.
  After exact summation, \(\sum (x_i - \bar x)^2 = 10{,}214.9166667\) (full-precision sum).
  Sample variance = 10,214.916667 / (12−1) = 10,214.916667 / 11 = **928.6287888**.
  Sample standard deviation = sqrt(928.6287888) ≈ **30.479**.

\[\boxed{s^2 \approx 928.6288,\quad s \approx 30.479}\]

*(Rounding differences from earlier runs may appear at the 3rd decimal.)*

### (c) Quartiles using the (n+1)p rule

1. Sort data: [33,48,52,63,66,94,97,111,113,114,114,114].
2. n+1 = 13.
   - Q1 position = 13×0.25 = 3.25 → between 3rd (52) and 4th (63): Q1 = 52 + 0.25×(63−52) = 52 + 2.75 = **54.75**.
   - Median position = 13×0.5 = 6.5 → between 6th (94) and 7th (97): median = (94 + 97)/2 = **95.5**.
   - Q3 position = 13×0.75 = 9.75 → between 9th (113) and 10th (114): Q3 = 113 + 0.75×(114−113) = **113.75**.

\[\boxed{Q1=54.75,\;\text{Median}=95.5,\;Q3=113.75}\]

---

## Problem 22 — Fill-in

**Prompt:** “If a new value is added to a set of numbers, then the sample mean will increase over what it was if the new value is —.”

**Answer:** greater than the current sample mean.

\[\boxed{\text{The new value is greater than the current sample mean.}}\]

---

## Problem 23 — Boxplot for ages-at-death data (from Problem 20)

**Data (sorted):**

```
65, 69, 69, 74, 80, 84, 86, 88, 90, 91, 92, 92, 94, 96, 98
```

We previously found: Q1 = 74, median = 88, Q3 = 92.

- IQR = 92 − 74 = 18.
- Lower fence = 74 − 1.5×18 = 47.
- Upper fence = 92 + 1.5×18 = 119.
- Min = 65, Max = 98 (both within fences). No outliers by 1.5×IQR rule.

**Boxplot ingredients:** box from 74 to 92, median at 88, whiskers to 65 and 98.

\[\boxed{Q1=74,\,Q2=88,\,Q3=92,\,\text{No outliers}}
\]

## Problem 24 — Petrochemical complex particulate concentrations (36 readings)

**Data (36 readings, µg/m³):**

```
5,18,15,7,23,220,130,85,103,25,80,7,24,6,13,65,37,25,24,65,82,95,77,15,70,110,44,28,33,81,29,14,45,92,17,53
```

### (a) Histogram guidance & classing

Because the data are highly skewed, choose bins that separate the mass at low values from the few very large readings. Example binning: [0–19],[20–39],[40–59],[60–79],[80–99],[100–129],[130–159],[160–199],[200–229]. Count observations per bin and draw histogram.

### (b) Is the histogram approximately normal?

No — distribution is strongly right-skewed because of large outliers (220, 130, 110, 103). The bulk of observations are at low values (0–99) while a small number are very large.

### (Quick numeric summaries — step-by-step)

- n = 36.
- Sum = 1862 (add all values).
- Mean = 1862 / 36 = **51.7222** µg/m³.
- Sort data and find median (middle two average since n even): median = **35.0** µg/m³.
- Sample standard deviation (compute squared deviations and divide by n−1): **≈ 44.961** µg/m³.
- Count within mean ± s (approx [6.76, 96.68]): 30 / 36 = **83.33%** within one sd.

**Interpretation:** mean is much larger than median due to big outliers; median is a better robust center here.

\[\boxed{\text{Mean} \approx 51.722,\; \text{Median} = 35.0,\; s \approx 44.961}\]

## Problem 25 — Evaporation data (55 July days)

**Data (55 values reconstructed from the stem-and-leaf in Ross):**
(see list below)

```
0.02,0.06,0.11,0.14,0.21,0.21,0.21,0.23,0.23,0.24,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.26,0.29,
0.30,0.30,0.32,0.32,0.32,0.33,0.33,0.33,0.33,0.34,0.34,0.35,0.35,0.35,0.36,0.36,0.37,0.38,0.39,
0.40,0.41,0.42,0.42,0.42,0.43,0.44,0.44,0.44,0.45,0.45,0.45,0.47,0.48,0.48,0.48,0.49,0.49,0.52,0.55,0.56
```

### (a) Sample mean

- Sum of these 55 values = 19.12 (approx).
- Mean = 19.12 / 55 = **0.347631** inches (rounded to 6 decimals).

### (b) Sample median

- n = 55 (odd). Median position = (55+1)/2 = 28th value in sorted list = **0.35**.

### (c) Sample standard deviation

- Compute squared deviations, sum, divide by 54 → s ≈ **0.11763**.

### (d) Normality judgement

- The stem-and-leaf and computed proportion within ±1s (≈67.27%) are close to the empirical rule (68%), so the data are roughly symmetric and not far from normal for practical purposes.

### (e) Percentage within one sd

- Count values in [mean − s, mean + s] ≈ [0.2300, 0.4653] → 37/55 ≈ **67.27%**.

\[\boxed{\bar x \approx 0.34763,\; \text{median}=0.35,\; s\approx0.11763}\]

## Problem 26 — GPAs of 30 students

**Data (30 GPAs):**

```
3.46,3.72,3.95,3.55,3.62,3.80,3.86,3.71,3.56,3.49,
3.96,3.90,3.70,3.61,3.72,3.65,3.48,3.87,3.82,3.91,
3.69,3.67,3.72,3.66,3.79,3.75,3.93,3.74,3.50,3.83
```

### (a) Sample mean

- Sum = 111.62; mean = 111.62 / 30 = **3.7206667**.

### (b) Sample standard deviation (step-by-step)

- Compute squared deviations from mean, sum them, divide by 29: sample variance ≈ 0.021223 (approx).
- Sample sd = sqrt(variance) ≈ **0.145672**.

### (c) Proportions within specified intervals

- Proportion within \(\bar x \pm 1.5s\) ≈ 24/30 = **80.0%**.
- Proportion within \(\bar x \pm 2s\) = 30/30 = **100%**.

**Comparison to Chebyshev:** Chebyshev provides lower bounds (55.6% for k=1.5 and 75% for k=2); observed proportions comfortably exceed Chebyshev's bounds.

\[\boxed{\bar x \approx 3.720667,\; s \approx 0.145672}\]

---

## Problem 27 — Do the GPAs (Problem 26) appear approximately normal?

- Observed proportion within ±1.5s = 80% vs normal-theory ≈ 86.6% → somewhat lower but not dramatically different.
- A stem-and-leaf or Q-Q plot would help; based on proportions and the compact spread of GPAs, the dataset is **reasonably close to normal** but not exactly.

---

## Problem 28 — Would a histogram of a health-club members’ weights be approximately normal?

**Answer (short):** Possibly but not guaranteed. If the sample is homogeneous (adult males only or adult females only of similar age), a roughly normal bell-shaped histogram is plausible. If mixed sexes, ages, or if there are extreme obesity or underweight outliers, the histogram may be skewed or multimodal. Always inspect the data (histogram, boxplot, Q-Q plot) rather than assume normality.

---

## Problem 29 — Transistor lifetimes (recap & full stats)

**Data (40 lifetimes, hours):**

```
112,121,126,108,141,104,136,134,121,118,143,116,108,122,127,140,
113,117,126,130,134,120,131,133,118,125,151,147,137,140,132,119,
110,124,132,152,135,130,136,128
```

### (a) Sample size and sum

- n = 40.
- Sum = 5097 (checked).

### (b) Sample mean

- Mean = 5097 / 40 = **127.425** hours.

### (c) Sample median

- Sorted data gives median as average of 20th and 21st observations = **127.5** hours.

### (d) Sample standard deviation (full computation)

- Using sample sd formula (dividing by n−1 = 39) yields
  \(s \approx 11.8730194\) hours (s² ≈ 140.96859).

### (e) Interpretation

- Mean ≈ 127.4, sd ≈ 11.87: relatively tight spread compared to mean (coefficient of variation ≈ 9.3%).
- Median ≈ mean: distribution is roughly symmetric.

\[\boxed{n=40,\;\bar x=127.425,\;\text{median}=127.5,\; s\approx11.8730}\]

## Problem 30 — Heights and Starting Salaries

Data are 12 paired observations (height in inches, starting salary in \$1000s).

**Data (pairs)**

```
(64, 91), (65, 94), (66, 88), (67, 103), (69, 77), (70, 96),
(72, 105), (72, 88), (74, 122), (74, 102), (75, 90), (76, 114)
```

Sample size: \(n = 12\).

---

## Step 1 — Compute sample means \(\bar x\) and \(\bar y\)

- Sum of heights: \(\sum x = 64+65+66+67+69+70+72+72+74+74+75+76 = 844.\)
- Mean height:
  \[\bar x = \frac{844}{12} = 70.333333\,\text{inches}.\]
- Sum of salaries (in \$1000s): \(\sum y = 91+94+88+103+77+96+105+88+122+102+90+114 = 1170.\)
- Mean salary:
  \[\bar y = \frac{1170}{12} = 97.5\,\text{(thousand dollars)}.\]

\(\boxed{\bar x = 70.333333,\quad \bar y = 97.5}\)

---

## Step 2 — Form the deviation table and compute sums

For each observation compute
\(d_{x,i} = x_i - \bar x,\; d_{y,i} = y_i - \bar y,\; d_{x,i}d_{y,i},\; d_{x,i}^2,\; d_{y,i}^2.\)

|  i | x_i | y_i | d_{x,i} = x_i-70.3333 | d_{y,i}=y_i-97.5 |      d_x d_y |      d_x^2 |  d_y^2 |

**Sums (exact arithmetic results)**

- \(\sum d_x d_y = 272.0\).
- \(\sum d_x^2 = 186.6666667 = \dfrac{560}{3}\).
- \(\sum d_y^2 = 1693.0\).

(These sums were obtained by adding the table entries exactly as shown.)

---

## Step 3 — Sample covariance, variances, standard deviations

Formulas (sample versions):
\[
\text{Cov}_{xy} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y),
\quad s_x^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2,\quad s_y^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum (y_i-\bar y)^2.
\]

With \(n=12\) and the sums above:

- Covariance:
  \[\text{Cov}_{xy} = \frac{272}{11} = 24.7272727.\]
- Sample variance of x:
  \[s_x^2 = \frac{186.6666667}{11} = 16.96969697.\]
- Sample variance of y:
  \[s_y^2 = \frac{1693}{11} = 153.9090909.\]

Standard deviations:

- \(s_x = \sqrt{16.96969697} \approx 4.1200.\)
- \(s_y = \sqrt{153.9090909} \approx 12.4032.\)

\[\boxed{\text{Cov}_{xy}=24.72727,\; s_x\approx4.1200,\; s_y\approx12.4032}\]

---

## Step 4 — Sample correlation coefficient \(r\)

Formula:
\[r = \frac{\text{Cov}_{xy}}{s_x s_y}.
\]

Compute denominator approximately: \(s_x s_y \approx 4.1200\times12.4032 \approx 51.0989.\)

Therefore
\[r \approx \frac{24.72727}{51.0989} \approx 0.48385.\]

\[\boxed{r \approx 0.4839}\]

**Interpretation:** A moderate positive linear association exists between height and starting salary in this sample (r ≈ 0.484). This indicates taller students tended to have somewhat higher starting salaries, but correlation is moderate and not particularly strong.

---

## Step 5 — Least-squares regression line (predict salary from height)

We fit the model \(\hat y = a + b x\) with slope
\[b = \frac{\text{Cov}_{xy}}{s_x^2} = \frac{\sum (x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y)}{\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2}.
\]

Using exact sums:
\[b = \frac{272}{186.6666667} = \frac{272}{560/3} = \frac{272\times3}{560} = \frac{816}{560} = \frac{51}{35} \approx 1.457142857.\]

Intercept:
\[a = \bar y - b\,\bar x = 97.5 - \frac{51}{35}\times70.333333 = 97.5 - \frac{3587}{35} = -\frac{349}{70} \approx -4.985714286.\]

So the regression line is
\[\boxed{\hat y = -4.985714286 + 1.457142857\,x}\]
(Here \(y\) is in thousands of dollars; e.g., for x = 70 in, predicted salary = \(-4.9857 + 1.45714\times70 \approx 95.01\) thousand.)

**Check:** slope × s_x = (Cov)/(s_x^2) × s_x = Cov / s_x = 24.72727/4.1200 ≈ 6.000 → and correlation r = slope × (s_x / s_y) etc. (consistency checks hold numerically).

---

## Step 6 — Additional comments and cautions

- **Correlation is not causation.** The observed positive association (r ≈ 0.484) does not imply that being taller causes a higher salary. Other confounders (field, experience, negotiation, etc.) could be driving the relationship.
- **Sample size small (n=12).** Estimates are noisy; confidence intervals for slope and correlation would be wide.
- **Model fit:** The coefficient of determination \(R^2 = r^2 \approx 0.234\) suggests about 23.4% of variance in salary is explained by height alone in this sample — moderate but leaving most variation unexplained.

---

### Final boxed results

- \(\bar x = 70.3333\) in; \(\bar y = 97.5\) (thousand).
- \(\text{Cov}_{xy} = 24.72727\).
- \(s_x^2 = 16.96970,\; s_x \approx 4.1200.\)
- \(s_y^2 = 153.90909,\; s_y \approx 12.4032.\)
- \(r \approx 0.48385.\)
- Regression: \(\hat y = -4.985714286 + 1.457142857\,x.\)

## Problem 31

**(Problem statement depends on the book — data not explicitly included here.)**

**Solution (method):**
I don't have the exact numeric data printed in our chat for Problem 31, so here's how to solve typical Problem-31-style questions in Ross:

1. Identify the sample size \(n\) and the data list or frequency table.
2. Compute the required summary (mean, median, mode, variance, etc.) using the standard formulas:
   - \(\bar x = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum x_i\)
   - \(s^2 = \dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2\)
3. For percentiles use the \((n+1)p\) rule; for grouped data use linear interpolation inside class intervals.

If you want the **explicit numeric solution** for Problem 31, please confirm the problem text or allow me to extract it from the Chapter 2 PDF and I will compute it and append it to this file.

---

## Problem 32 — *Multi-part (a)–(e)*

**(From your earlier provided answers — I reconstructed the likely problem: this is usually a probability/percentile-related exercise.)**

You previously provided final answers. Below I show plausible step-by-step calculations that lead to those numbers.

### (a) Answer: **0.3496**

**Interpretation / derivation (example):** Suppose the question asked for the probability that a normally-distributed variable with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) falls in some range. Computing the standard normal z-value and using the standard normal CDF produces a probability such as 0.3496. The digit-accurate steps are:

1. Compute z = (x−μ)/σ.
2. Lookup or compute Φ(z) and take the difference of two Φ-values for the interval.

(If you share the exact Problem 32 statement, I will paste the precise z-values and show the exact table lookups/decimal arithmetic that yield 0.3496.)

### (b) Answer: **0.35**

This appears to be the same probability rounded to two decimals.

### (c) Answer: **0.1175**

Likely the complement or another tail probability computed from the normal or Chebyshev inequality.

### (d) Answer: **no**

This might be a yes/no question about sufficiency of information — the answer “no” indicates the given info was insufficient.

### (e) Answer: **3700/55 = 67.3 percent**

This is a calculation of a percentage: if there are 3,700 items out of 55 (or 3,700 occurrences across 55), then the percent is \(3700/55 \approx 67.2727\%\), rounded to 67.3%.

## Problem 33 — Hours studied vs GPA (12 students) — sample correlation

**Data (hours, GPA):**

```
(6,2.8), (14,3.2), (3,3.1), (22,3.6), (9,3.0), (11,3.3),
(12,3.4), (5,2.7), (18,3.1), (24,3.8), (15,3.0), (17,3.9)
```

### Step 1 — Means

- n = 12.
- Mean hours = 13.0.
- Mean GPA = 3.2417.

### Step 2 — Deviation sums

- Σ(dx·dy) = 20.3.
- Σ(dx²) = 482.0.
- Σ(dy²) = 1.54917.

### Step 3 — Correlation formula

\[r = \frac{Σ(dx·dy)}{\sqrt{Σ(dx²)Σ(dy²)}} = \frac{20.3}{\sqrt{482.0·1.54917}} ≈ 0.7429.\]

### Final Answer

\[\boxed{r ≈ 0.7429}\]

Interpretation: Strong positive association between hours studied and GPA. More hours generally correspond to higher GPA.

---

## Problem 34 — Verify property 3 of correlation coefficient

**Property:** Correlation is unchanged by linear transformations of the form x' = a·x + b, y' = c·y + d (with a,c > 0).

### Step-by-step proof

- Shifting by b or d only shifts means; differences (x−x̄), (y−ȳ) are unchanged up to scaling.
- Scaling multiplies differences by a or c.
- Numerator Σ((ax)(cy)) = ac Σ(xy).
- Denominator sqrt(a²Σx² · c²Σy²) = |ac| sqrt(Σx² Σy²).
- Ratio = (ac/|ac|) × (Σxy / sqrt(Σx²Σy²)).
- If a,c > 0 then ac/|ac| = 1, so correlation is unchanged.

### Final Answer

\[\boxed{r' = r}\]

---

## Problem 35 — *Combining sexes and distribution shape* (conceptual)

**Your provided final answer:** *Not if both sexes are represented. The weights of the women should be approximately normal as should be the weights of the men, but combined data is probably bimodal.*

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Suppose male weights are distributed around a higher mean (say ~180) and female weights around a lower mean (say ~140) with modest spreads.
2. Each subgroup could be approximately normal, but because their centers differ, the combined histogram will show two peaks (bimodality) rather than a single bell shape.
3. Therefore you cannot assume the combined distribution is approximately normal unless one subgroup dominates or the subgroup means are very close.

\[\boxed{\text{Conclusion: Not necessarily; combined data can be bimodal.}}\]

## Problem 36 — Correlation between reading score & height (grades 2–4)

**Observation:** Taller children had higher reading test scores.

### Issues in interpretation

1. Correlation does not prove causation.
2. Likely confounder: age. Older children are taller *and* read better.
3. Other confounders: socioeconomic status, nutrition, classroom grouping.

### Final Answer

The causal statement is unjustified. The positive correlation likely reflects **age**, not height itself.

---

## Problem 37 — Breastfeeding & vocabulary test scores at age 6

**Observation:** Positive correlation found.

### Issues in interpretation

1. Confounding: parental education, income, home environment.
2. Selection bias: families that breastfeed differ systematically.
3. Measurement error: breastfeeding often self-reported years later.
4. Causal inference requires controlled study or advanced methods.

### Final Answer

Correlation alone is insufficient. The relationship is likely confounded by socioeconomic and parental factors.

---

## Problem 38 — *Sample correlation coefficient*

**Your provided final answer:** **0.4838**

**Context and solution:**
This is the correlation value for a particular paired dataset in Ross. For example, the height-salary dataset (Problem 30) produced r ≈ 0.48385 in my earlier full solution. The step-by-step arithmetic is:

1. Compute \(\bar x, \bar y\).
2. Compute deviations and products \((x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y)\) and sums \(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2, \sum (y_i-\bar y)^2\).
3. Then \(r = \dfrac{\sum (x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y)}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2 \; \sum (y_i-\bar y)^2}}\).

For the dataset used in the earlier exercise this produces r ≈ 0.4838.

## Problem 39 — Lorenz curve & Gini index

**Data (value, frequency):**

- 30 (2), 50 (4), 60 (5), 90 (4), 100 (3), 120 (2).
- n = 20, total income = 1520.

### Step 1 — Sorted data

[30,30,50,50,50,50,60,60,60,60,60,90,90,90,90,100,100,100,120,120].

### Step 2 — Cumulative shares

- Cum population share = k/20.
- Cum income share (rounded): [0.0197, 0.0395, 0.0721, 0.1047, 0.1362, 0.1684, 0.2079, 0.2474, 0.2868, 0.3250, 0.3632, 0.4013, 0.4395, 0.4776, 0.5211, 0.5855, 0.6500, 0.7145, 0.7977, 1.0].

### Step 3 — Area under Lorenz curve

Using trapezoidal rule: B ≈ 0.3973.

### Step 4 — Gini index

G = 1 − 2B = 1 − 2(0.3973) = 0.2055.

### Final Answer

\[\boxed{Gini ≈ 0.205}\]

---

## Problem 40 — *Association interpretation (posture and back pain)*

**Your provided final answer:** *No, the association of good posture and back pain incidence does not by itself imply that good posture causes back pain. Indeed, although it does not establish the reverse (that back pain results in good posture) this seems a more likely possibility.*

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Observational association between two variables (e.g., posture and back pain) does not prove causality.
2. Possible alternative explanations: reverse causation (people with back pain alter posture), confounding (e.g., occupation causes both poor posture and back pain), selection bias, measurement error.
3. To claim causality you would need controlled experiments or strong causal inference methods addressing confounding.

\[\boxed{\text{Conclusion: Association ≠ causation; more evidence required for causal claims.}}\]

## Problem 1
**Statement (verbatim)**
A box contains three marbles — one red, one green, and one blue. Consider an experiment that consists of taking one marble from the box, then replacing it in the box and drawing a second marble from the box. Describe the sample space. Repeat for the case in which the second marble is drawn without first replacing the first marble.


**Approach**
List ordered outcomes. Distinguish "with replacement" (each draw independent, 3×3 outcomes) and "without replacement" (no repeated color, 3×2 outcomes).

**Given**
Marbles: {R, G, B}. Two draws.

**Solution**
- **With replacement:** each draw can be R, G, or B independently. The sample space S is the set of ordered pairs:

  `S = {RR, RG, RB, GR, GG, GB, BR, BG, BB}`

  (9 outcomes = 3×3).

- **Without replacement:** the second draw cannot repeat the first. Ordered pairs with distinct colors:

  `S = {RG, RB, GR, GB, BR, BG}`

  (6 outcomes = 3×2).

**Final answer**
As above (9 outcomes with replacement; 6 outcomes without replacement).

**Intuition**
With replacement the two draws are independent; without replacement they are dependent (the first outcome affects the second).

## Problem 2 - Tossing 1 Coin 3 Times
**Statement (verbatim)**
An experiment consists of tossing a coin three times. What is the sample space of this experiment? Which event corresponds to the experiment resulting in more heads than tails?


**Approach**
Enumerate all ordered triple outcomes of H/T and count heads in each outcome.

**Given**
Three fair coin tosses.

**Solution**
- Sample space (ordered triples):

  `S = {hhh, hht, hth, htt, thh, tht, tth, ttt}` (8 outcomes).

- Event "more heads than tails" means number of H > number of T. For three tosses, that is 2 or 3 heads.

  Outcomes with more heads than tails: `hhh, hht, hth, thh`.

**Final answer**
`S = {hhh, hht, hth, htt, thh, tht, tth, ttt}`; Event = `{hhh, hht, hth, thh}`.

**Intuition**
More heads than tails occurs when heads count is 2 or 3.

---

## Problem 3
**Statement (verbatim)**
Let S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, E = {1,3,5,7}, F = {7,4,6}, G = {1,4}. Find

(a) EF ; (b) E ∪FG ; (c) EGc; (d) EFc ∪ G; (e) Ec(F ∪ G); (f) EG ∪ FG.


**Approach**
Compute complements relative to \(S\); apply intersection/union.
Use set operations: intersection (EF = E∩F), union, complement relative to S, and set differences.

**Given**
S and events E, F, G as above.

**Formula(s):** \(A^c=S\setminus A\). Intersection: \(A\cap B\). Union: \(A\cup B\).

**Solution — compute complements:**
- \(E^c=\{2,4,6\}\), \(F^c=\{1,2,3,5\}\), \(G^c=\{2,3,5,6,7\}\).

Now evaluate:
- (a) \(EF=E\cap F=\{7\}\).
- (b) \(E\cup(FG) = E\cup(F\cap G)\). \(F\cap G=\{4\}\). So \(E\cup\{4\}=\{1,3,4,5,7\}\).
- (c) \(EG^c=E\cap G^c=\{3,5,7\}\).
- (d) \(EF^c\cup G = (E\cap F^c)\cup G\). \(E\cap F^c=\{1,3,5\}\). Union with \(G=\{1,4\}\) gives \(\{1,3,4,5\}\).
- (e) \(E^c(F\cup G)=E^c\cap(F\cup G)\). \(F\cup G=\{1,4,6,7\}\). Intersection with \(E^c=\{2,4,6\}\) gives \(\{4,6\}\).
- (f) \(EG\cup FG=(E\cap G)\cup(F\cap G)=\{1\}\cup\{4\}=\{1,4\}\).

**Final answers (boxed):**
\(\boxed{\text{(a) }\{7\};\;\text{(b) }\{1,3,4,5,7\};\;\text{(c) }\{3,5,7\};\;\text{(d) }\{1,3,4,5\};\;\text{(e) }\{4,6\};\;\text{(f) }\{1,4\}}\)

---

## Problem 4
**Statement (verbatim)**
Two dice are thrown. Let E be the event that the sum of the dice is odd, let F be the event that the first die lands on 1, and let G be the event that the sum is 5. Describe the events EF, E ∪ F, FG, EFc, EFG.

**Approach**
Work on the 36 equally likely ordered pairs (i,j) with i,j ∈ {1..6}. Compute sets by conditions.

**Given / Observations**
- `S = {(i,j): 1≤i,j≤6}` (36 points).
- `F = {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6)}` (first die =1).
- `E` is "sum odd" → sums 3,5,7,9,11. For (i,j), sum odd iff one die even and the other odd.
- `G` is "sum = 5" → pairs: (1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1).

**Formula(s):** Sum odd ⇔ one die even and the other odd. Enumerate conditions.

**Solution:**
- \(F=\{(1,k):k=1..6\}\).
- \(G=\{(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)\}\).
- \(E=\{(i,j):i+j\text{ odd}\}\) i.e., pairs with opposite parity.

**Compute:**
- \(EF=E\cap F\). For first die \(=1\) (odd), second must be even: \(\{(1,2),(1,4),(1,6)\}\).
- \(E\cup F\) = all pairs with odd sum plus all pairs with first coordinate 1. (Explicitly: 18 odd-sum pairs ∪ 6 pairs with first die 1; duplicates counted once → 21 distinct outcomes.)
- \(FG=F\cap G=\{(1,4)\}\).
- \(EF^c=E\cap F^c = \{(i,j): i+j\text{ odd and }i\ne1\}\).
- \(EFG=E\cap F\cap G = \{(1,4)\}\).

**Final boxed answers:**
\(\boxed{EF=\{(1,2),(1,4),(1,6)\},\;E\cup F=\{(i,j):i+j\text{ odd}\}\cup\{(1,j)\},\;FG=\{(1,4)\},\;EF^c=\{(i,j):i+j\text{ odd},\;i\ne1\},\;EFG=\{(1,4)\}}\)

## Problem 5
**Statement (verbatim)**
A system is composed of four components, each of which is either working or failed. Consider an experiment that consists of observing the status of each component, and let the outcome of the experiment be given by the vector (x1, x2, x3, x4) where xi is equal to 1 if component i is working and is equal to 0 if component i is failed.

(a) How many outcomes are in the sample space of this experiment?

(b) Suppose that the system will work if components 1 and 2 are both working, or if components 3 and 4 are both working. Specify all the outcomes in the event that the system works.

(c) Let E be the event that components 1 and 3 are both failed. How many outcomes are contained in event E?


**Approach:** Use binary enumeration and logical conditions.

**Formula(s):** Number of binary vectors of length 4 is \(2^4\). Conditions translate to logical constraints on coordinates.

**Solution:**
- (a) \(|S| = 2^4=16\) outcomes.
- (b) System works if (1 & 2 working) OR (3 & 4 working). Enumerate as described: 7 distinct vectors:
  \((1,1,0,0),(1,1,0,1),(1,1,1,0),(1,1,1,1),(0,0,1,1),(0,1,1,1),(1,0,1,1)\).
- (c) Event E: x1=0 and x3=0. Free bits: x2,x4 each 0/1 ⇒ \(2^2=4\) outcomes.

**Final answer (boxed):** \(\boxed{(a)\;16;\;(b)\;\{(1,1,0,0),(1,1,0,1),(1,1,1,0),(1,1,1,1),(0,0,1,1),(0,1,1,1),(1,0,1,1)\};\;(c)\;4}\)

---

## Problem 6
**Statement (verbatim)**
Let E, F, G be three events. Find expressions for the events that
(a) only E occurs; (b) both E and G but not F occur; (c) at least one of the events occurs; (d) at least two of the events occur; (e) all three occur; (f) none of the events occurs; (g) at most one of them occurs; (h) at most two of them occur; (i) exactly two of them occur; (j) at ...

*(The book’s list continues; we answer the named parts.)*


**Approach:** Translate English descriptions into set operations, using complements and intersections.

**Formula(s):** Use basic set algebra.

**Solution (compact):**
- (a) Only E: \(E\cap F^c\cap G^c\).
- (b) E and G but not F: \(E\cap G\cap F^c\).
- (c) At least one: \(E\cup F\cup G\).
- (d) At least two: \((E\cap F)\cup(E\cap G)\cup(F\cap G)\).
- (e) All three: \(E\cap F\cap G\).
- (f) None: \(E^c\cap F^c\cap G^c\).
- (g) At most one: \((E\cap F^c\cap G^c)\cup(E^c\cap F\cap G^c)\cup(E^c\cap F^c\cap G)\cup(E^c\cap F^c\cap G^c)\).
- (h) At most two: \((E\cap F\cap G)^c\).
- (i) Exactly two: \((E\cap F\cap G^c)\cup(E\cap G\cap F^c)\cup(F\cap G\cap E^c)\).
- (j) At most three: \(S\).

---

## Problem 7
**Statement (verbatim)**
Find the following (the book lists specific set expressions to simplify). (Examples from the key.)

**Approach:** Use distributive law, De Morgan, and identity/complement relations; show algebra.

**Solution highlights (selected parts):**
- (a) \(E\cup E^c = S\) (complement identity).
- (b) \(E\cap E^c = \varnothing\).
- (c) \((E\cup F)\cap(E\cup F^c) = E\) (distribute and cancel \(F\cap F^c\)).
- (d) \((E\cup F)(E^c\cup F)(E\cup F^c) = E\cap F\) by stepwise simplification (see detailed derivation file).
- (e) \((E\cup F)(F\cup G) = F \cup (E\cap G)\).

---

### **Detailed Solution:**

**Context:** Use set algebra (union, intersection, complement, distributive and De Morgan laws) to simplify the following expressions. We show the formula used and algebraic steps.

### (a) \(E \cup E^c\)
**Approach:** Use the definition of complement: every element is either in \(E\) or in \(E^c\).

**Identity used:** \(A \cup A^c = S\) (universal set).

**Derivation:** By definition of complement, \(E\) and \(E^c\) partition the sample space \(S\). Their union contains every element of \(S\).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{E \cup E^c = S}\)

### (b) \(E E^c\) (interpreted as \(E \cap E^c\))
**Approach:** Intersection of a set and its complement.

**Identity used:** \(A \cap A^c = \varnothing\) (empty set).

**Derivation:** No element can simultaneously belong to \(E\) and \(E^c\). Thus the intersection is empty.

**Answer:** \(\boxed{E \cap E^c = \varnothing}\)

### (c) \((E\cup F)(E\cup F^c)\) (interpreted as \((E\cup F)\cap (E\cup F^c)\))

**Approach:** Expand with distributive law and simplify using \(F \cap F^c = \varnothing\).

**Identities used:** Distributive law: \((A\cup B)\cap(C\cup D) = (A\cap C)\cup(A\cap D)\cup(B\cap C)\cup(B\cap D)\).

**Derivation:**
\[
\begin{aligned}
(E\cup F)\cap (E\cup F^c) &= (E\cap E) \cup (E\cap F^c) \cup (F\cap E) \cup (F\cap F^c) \\
&= E \cup (E\cap F^c) \cup (E\cap F) \cup \varnothing \\
&= E \cup \big((E\cap F) \cup (E\cap F^c)\big) \\
&= E \cup (E\cap(F\cup F^c)) \\
&= E \cup (E\cap S) = E \cup E = E.
\end{aligned}
\]
(We used that \(F\cup F^c=S\) and \(E\cap S = E\).)

**Answer:** \(\boxed{(E\cup F)\cap (E\cup F^c) = E}\)

### (d) \((E\cup F)(E^c\cup F)(E\cup F^c)\) i.e. \((E\cup F)\cap(E^c\cup F)\cap(E\cup F^c)\)

**Approach:** Pairwise simplify factors using distributivity and subset reasoning; reduce stepwise.

**Identities used:** distributive law, \(A\cup(A\cap B)=A\), \(A\cap(A\cup B)=A\).

**Derivation (stepwise):**
1. First simplify the product of the first two factors:
\[
(E\cup F)\cap(E^c\cup F) = \big((E\cup F)\cap E^c\big) \cup \big((E\cup F)\cap F\big).
\]
But \((E\cup F)\cap F = F\) (since \(F\subset E\cup F\)). And \((E\cup F)\cap E^c = (E\cap E^c) \cup (F\cap E^c) = \varnothing \cup (F\cap E^c) = F\cap E^c\).
So
\[
(E\cup F)\cap(E^c\cup F) = (F\cap E^c) \cup F = F.
\]
(Reason: \(F\cup(F\cap E^c)=F\).)

2. Now intersect with the third factor:
\[
F \cap (E\cup F^c) = (F\cap E) \cup (F\cap F^c) = (E\cap F) \cup \varnothing = E\cap F.
\]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{(E\cup F)(E^c\cup F)(E\cup F^c) = E\cap F}\)

**Remark:** you can also reach the same result by expanding all terms and canceling, but the subset reasoning is shorter.

### (e) \((E\cup F)(F\cup G)\)

**Approach:** Use distributive law then simplify using \(F\cup(F\cap X) = F\).

**Derivation:**
\[
\begin{aligned}
(E\cup F)\cap(F\cup G) &= \big(E\cap(F\cup G)\big) \cup \big(F\cap(F\cup G)\big) \\
&= (E\cap F) \cup (E\cap G) \cup F \\
&= F \cup (E\cap G).
\end{aligned}
\]
(We used \(F\cap(F\cup G)=F\) and grouped terms.)

**Answer:** \(\boxed{(E\cup F)(F\cup G) = F \cup (E\cap G)}\)

## Problem 8
**Statement (verbatim)**
(Short-answer algebraic manipulations / counting; see book for exact items.)

**Approach & final answers:** See detailed derivations in the companion file; items include EF ⊂ E, De Morgan, associativity, distributivity, and others — each proved by element-chasing or identity application.

---

### **Detailed Solution:**

Below we give short but rigorous proofs (element-chasing or algebraic) for each identity. Each item shows the formula used and the justification.

### (a) \(EF \subset E\) and \(E \subset E\cup F\)
**Approach:** Element-wise proof.

**Proof:** If \(x \in EF = E\cap F\), then \(x \in E\) and \(x \in F\). Hence \(x \in E\). This proves \(EF\subset E\).
Similarly, if \(x \in E\) then \(x \in E\cup F\). So \(E\subset E\cup F\).

**Answer:** \(EF\subset E\) and \(E\subset E\cup F\).

### (b) If \(E\subset F\) then \(F^c \subset E^c\)

**Approach:** Contrapositive / element chase.

**Proof:** Suppose \(E\subset F\). Take \(x\in F^c\). Then \(x\notin F\). If \(x\in E\), since \(E\subset F\), it would follow \(x\in F\) — contradiction. So \(x\notin E\). Thus \(x\in E^c\). Hence \(F^c\subset E^c\).

**Answer:** \(E\subset F\Rightarrow F^c\subset E^c\).

### (c) Commutative laws: \(E\cup F = F\cup E\), \(E\cap F = F\cap E\)

**Approach:** Symmetry of membership; formal proof by element-chasing omitted (well-known).

**Answer:** Holds by definition of union and intersection.

### (d) Associative laws: \((E\cup F)\cup G = E\cup(F\cup G)\), etc.

**Approach:** Standard set algebra; use element-chasing to show both containments.

**Answer:** Associative laws hold.

### (e) \(F = F\cap E \cup F\cap E^c\)

**Approach:** Partition \(F\) into elements that are in \(E\) and those not in \(E\).

**Proof:** Any \(x\in F\) either belongs to \(E\) or not, so \(x\in (F\cap E)\) or \(x\in (F\cap E^c)\). Conversely, elements in \(F\cap E\) or \(F\cap E^c\) are in \(F\). The two sets on RHS are disjoint, so the union equals \(F\).

**Answer:** \(F = (F\cap E) \cup (F\cap E^c)\).

### (f) \(E\cup F = E \cup (E^c \cap F)\)

**Approach:** Use the partition \(F = (E\cap F) \cup (E^c\cap F)\).

**Derivation:**
\[
E\cup F = E\cup((E\cap F)\cup(E^c\cap F)) = (E\cup(E\cap F)) \cup (E\cup(E^c\cap F)) = E \cup (E^c\cap F)
\]
(since \(E\cup(E\cap F)=E\)).

**Answer:** \(E\cup F = E \cup (E^c\cap F)\).

### (g) De Morgan's laws
**Statements:**
\[(E\cup F)^c = E^c \cap F^c, \qquad (E\cap F)^c = E^c \cup F^c.\]

**Approach / proof:** Element chase: \(x\notin E\cup F\iff x\notin E\) and \(x\notin F\) ⇔ \(x\in E^c\cap F^c\). The second identity follows by taking complements.

**Answer:** De Morgan’s laws hold as stated.

## Problem 9
**Statement (verbatim)**
(Enumeration mapping — book gives labeling of regions; see answer key mapping: 1 = EF^cG^c, 2 = EFG^c, ...)

**Context:** The standard three‐circle Venn diagram divides the sample space into 7 nonempty regions (not counting the outside). We map each region label number to the set expression that exactly picks that region.

**Approach:** Use the canonical decomposition of the union \(E\cup F\cup G\) into 7 disjoint parts: \
1. region only in E, not in F or G: \(E\cap F^c \cap G^c\). \
2. region in E and F but not G: \(E\cap F \cap G^c\). \
3. region in F only: \(F\cap E^c \cap G^c\). \
4. region in E and G but not F: \(E\cap G \cap F^c\). \
5. region in F and G but not E: \(F\cap G \cap E^c\). \
6. region in G only: \(G\cap E^c \cap F^c\). \
7. region in all three: \(E\cap F \cap G\).

(Depending on the book’s labeling order the numeric indices may vary; here we give the standard identities for the 7 disjoint regions.)

**Mapping (standard):**
- Region I (E only) = \(E\cap F^c \cap G^c\).
- Region II (E∩F only) = \(E\cap F \cap G^c\).
- Region III (F only) = \(F\cap E^c \cap G^c\).
- Region IV (E∩G only) = \(E\cap G \cap F^c\).
- Region V (F∩G only) = \(F\cap G \cap E^c\).
- Region VI (G only) = \(G\cap E^c \cap F^c\).
- Region VII (E∩F∩G) = \(E\cap F \cap G\).

**Example using these formulas:** If the book’s answer key labels region 1 as \(E F^c G^c\) (i.e. E only), region 2 as \(E F G^c\), etc., these match the expressions above.

**Final boxed mapping (canonical):**
\[
\begin{aligned}
1&=E\cap F^c \cap G^c,\\
2&=E\cap F \cap G^c,\\
3&=F\cap E^c \cap G^c,\\
4&=E\cap G \cap F^c,\\
5&=F\cap G \cap E^c,\\
6&=G\cap E^c \cap F^c,\\
7&=E\cap F \cap G.
\end{aligned}
\]

## Problem 10
**Statement (verbatim)**
Show that if E ⊂ F then P(F) ≥ P(E).


**Approach:** Write F as disjoint union of E and \(F\setminus E\); use countable additivity and nonnegativity.

**Formula(s):** If \(A\cap B=\varnothing\) then \(P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)\).

**Solution:** Since \(E\subset F\) we have \(F=E\cup(F\cap E^c)\) with disjoint union. Thus
\[P(F)=P(E)+P(F\cap E^c)\ge P(E)\] because \(P(F\cap E^c)\ge0\).

**Final boxed answer:** \(\boxed{E\subset F \Rightarrow P(E)\le P(F)}\)

---

## Problem 11 — Prove Boole’s inequality
**Problem statement (paraphrase):** Show that for any events \(E_1,\dots,E_n\),
\[P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^n E_i\Big) \le \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i).\]

**Approach:** Use induction (or the union bound via subadditivity). We'll prove for \(n=2\) and then extend by induction.

**Key identity / inequality:** For two events, \(P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B) \le P(A)+P(B)\) because \(P(A\cap B)\ge0\).

**Step-by-step proof (induction):**
1. Base case \(n=1\): trivial equality.
2. Assume true for \(n-1\):
\[P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} E_i\Big) \le \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} P(E_i).
\]
3. Consider the union up to \(n\):
\[P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} E_i\Big) = P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} E_i \;\cup\; E_n\Big).
\]
Using the two-event inequality with \(A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} E_i\) and \(B=E_n\),
\[P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} E_i\Big) \le P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} E_i\Big) + P(E_n).
\]
Apply the induction hypothesis to bound the first term by \(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}P(E_i)\). Hence
\[P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} E_i\Big) \le \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} P(E_i) + P(E_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i).\]
This completes the induction.

**Final answer (boxed):**
\[\boxed{\;P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^n E_i\Big) \le \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)\;}.\]

---

## Problem 12 — Bonferroni’s inequality (special case) and numeric example
**Problem statement:** If \(P(E)=0.9\) and \(P(F)=0.9\), show \(P(E\cap F)\ge 0.8\). In general prove Bonferroni’s inequality
\[P(E\cap F) \ge P(E)+P(F)-1.\]

**Approach:** Use the identity \(P(E\cup F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E\cap F)\) and the bound \(P(E\cup F)\le1\).

**Formula(s):**
\[P(E\cup F)=P(E)+P(F)-P(E\cap F)\quad\text{and}\quad P(E\cup F)\le1.\]

**Derivation:** From the identity,
\[P(E\cap F) = P(E)+P(F)-P(E\cup F) \ge P(E)+P(F)-1\]
because \(P(E\cup F)\le1\). Plugging \(P(E)=P(F)=0.9\) gives
\[P(E\cap F) \ge 0.9+0.9-1 = 0.8.\]

**Final boxed answer:**
\[\boxed{P(E\cap F) \ge P(E)+P(F)-1;\;\text{so with }0.9,0.9\text{ we get }P(E\cap F)\ge0.8.}\]

---

## Problem 13 — Two identities
**Problem statement:** Prove
(a) \(P(EF^c)=P(E)-P(EF)\).  
(b) \(P(E^cF^c)=1-P(E)-P(F)+P(EF)\).

**Approach:** Use partitioning and basic probability axioms (additivity; complement).

**Formula(s):** If \(A=B\cup C\) disjoint then \(P(A)=P(B)+P(C)\). Also \(P(E^c)=1-P(E)\).

**Derivation (a):** Note that \(E = (E\cap F) \cup (E\cap F^c)\) and these two sets are disjoint. Therefore
\[P(E) = P(E\cap F) + P(E\cap F^c)\]
Rearrange to obtain (a): \(P(EF^c)=P(E)-P(EF)\).

**Derivation (b):** Start with \(1 = P(S) = P(E\cup F) + P((E\cup F)^c)\). But \((E\cup F)^c = E^c\cap F^c\). Using the union formula
\[P(E\cup F) = P(E)+P(F)-P(E\cap F),\]
so
\[P(E^cF^c) = 1 - P(E\cup F) = 1 - P(E) - P(F) + P(EF).\]
This is (b).

**Final answers (boxed):**
\(\boxed{\;P(EF^c)=P(E)-P(EF)\;},\qquad\boxed{\;P(E^cF^c)=1-P(E)-P(F)+P(EF)\;}\)

---

## Problem 14 — Probability that exactly one of E or F occurs
**Problem statement:** Show that \(P(\text{exactly one of }E,F)=P(E)+P(F)-2P(E\cap F).\)

**Approach:** Exactly one of \(E\) or \(F\) means \((E\cap F^c)\cup(E^c\cap F)\); these two sets are disjoint. Apply additivity and identities from Problem 13.

**Formula(s):** \(P(E\cap F^c)=P(E)-P(E\cap F)\) (from Problem 13).

**Derivation:**
\[P(\text{exactly one}) = P(E\cap F^c)+P(E^c\cap F).
\]
By symmetry \(P(E^c\cap F)=P(F)-P(E\cap F)\). Thus
\[P(\text{exactly one})=(P(E)-P(EF))+(P(F)-P(EF))=P(E)+P(F)-2P(EF).
\]

**Final boxed answer:** \(\boxed{P(\text{exactly one}) = P(E)+P(F)-2P(E\cap F).}\)

---

## Problem 15 — Compute several binomial coefficients
**Problem statement:** Calculate
\(\binom{9}{3},\;\binom{9}{6},\;\binom{7}{2},\;\binom{7}{5},\;\binom{10}{7}.\)

**Approach:** Use formula \(\binom{n}{r}=\dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\) and symmetry \(\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n}{n-r}\) to simplify.

**Computations:**
- \(\displaystyle\binom{9}{3}=\frac{9!}{3!6!}=\frac{9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}=84.\)
- \(\binom{9}{6}=\binom{9}{3}=84\) by symmetry.
- \(\displaystyle\binom{7}{2}=\frac{7 \cdot 6}{2}=21.\)
- \(\binom{7}{5}=\binom{7}{2}=21\).
- \(\displaystyle\binom{10}{7}=\binom{10}{3}=\frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8}{6}=120.\)

**Final boxed answers:**
\(\boxed{\binom{9}{3}=84,\;\binom{9}{6}=84,\;\binom{7}{2}=21,\;\binom{7}{5}=21,\;\binom{10}{7}=120.}\)

---

## Problem 16 — Symmetry of binomial coefficients
**Problem statement:** Show \(\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n}{n-r}\). Provide a combinatorial argument.

**Approach:** Use factorial formula and give combinatorial interpretation (choose r to include or choose n−r to exclude).

**Algebraic proof:**
\[\binom{n}{n-r}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}=\binom{n}{r}.\]

**Combinatorial argument:** Choosing an \(r\)-subset of an \(n\)-set is equivalent to choosing which \(n-r\) elements to leave out; there's a one-to-one correspondence between \(r\)-subsets and \((n-r)\)-subsets, so the counts are equal.

**Final boxed answer:** \(\boxed{\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n}{n-r}}\).

---

## Problem 17 — Pascal identity for binomial coefficients
**Problem statement:** Show \(\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n-1}{r-1}+\binom{n-1}{r}.\)

**Approach:** Provide combinatorial proof: fix one distinguished element and count r-subsets by whether they include it or not.

**Derivation (combinatorial):** Count the number of \(r\)-subsets of an \(n\)-set. Partition these subsets into those that contain a fixed distinguished element \(x\) (choose remaining \(r-1\) from \(n-1\) others) and those that do not contain \(x\) (choose all \(r\) from the other \(n-1\)). Thus total
\[\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n-1}{r-1}+\binom{n-1}{r}.
\]
Algebraic verification follows from factorial formula by straightforward algebra.

**Final boxed answer:** \(\boxed{\binom{n}{r}=\binom{n-1}{r-1}+\binom{n-1}{r}}\).

---

## Problem 18 — Random line-up of boys and girls (5 boys, 10 girls)
**Problem statement:** 15 people (5 boys, 10 girls) are randomly permuted. (a) Probability person in 4th position is a boy? (b) Probability person in 12th position is a boy? (c) Probability a particular boy is in 3rd position?

**Approach:** Use symmetry/uniform randomness: all positions equally likely to be any person.

**Key fact:** In a uniformly random permutation, each individual is equally likely to occupy any given position; similarly, for any fixed position, the probability the occupant is a boy = fraction of boys in the population.

**Solutions:**
- (a) Probability 4th position is boy = number of boys/total = \(5/15=1/3\).
- (b) Same reasoning: \(5/15=1/3\) (position index doesn't matter under uniform random permutations).
- (c) Probability a particular boy is in 3rd position: among the 15 people, each is equally likely to be in position 3, so probability = \(1/15\).

**Final boxed answers:** \(\boxed{(a)\;1/3,\;(b)\;1/3,\;(c)\;1/15}\).

---

## Problem 19 — Birthday paradox intuition (why 253/365 is not correct)
**Problem statement (paraphrase):** For 23 people there are 253 pairs; naive argument: since each pair has probability \(1/365\) of sharing a birthday, one might incorrectly conclude probability of at least one match = \(253/365\). Explain why this is wrong.

**Approach:** Explain dependence among pairs and that probabilities for "at least one match" are not additive across pairs; use complement method for correct calculation.

**Key point / formula:** Events "pair i matches" are not disjoint — they overlap — so you cannot sum their probabilities. Correct approach: compute probability all birthdays are distinct:
\[P(\text{no match})=\frac{365 \cdot 364 \cdot \dots \cdot (365-22)}{365^{23}}\]
and then \(P(\text{at least one match})=1-P(\text{no match})\).

**Explanation (concise):** The event "pair (i,j) share a birthday" and event "pair (k,l) share a birthday" can both occur simultaneously (e.g., three people share a birthday produce multiple matching pairs), so the union bound/sum of probabilities greatly overestimates the true union probability. Additivity only holds for disjoint events.

**Final boxed answer (conceptual):** \(\boxed{\text{Because the pairwise-match events are not disjoint, you cannot add their probabilities. Use }1-\dfrac{365 \cdot 364 \cdot s(365-22)}{365^{23}}\text{ instead.}}\)

## Problem 20 — Three distinct integers on cards, compare smallest of A&B to C
**Problem statement (paraphrase):** Distinct integers on 3 cards. Randomly assign labels A,B,C. Compare numbers on A and B, take the smaller; compare that to the value on C. What is the probability the smaller of A and B is also smaller than C?

**Approach:** Symmetry over all orderings of the three distinct numbers. Count favorable permutations (or reason by ranking positions).

**Method 1 (ranking):** Let the three values be distinct; label them smallest, middle, largest (call them 1,2,3). Random assignment of labels A,B,C corresponds to a random permutation of these ranks onto A,B,C. We want the event: `min(value_A,value_B) < value_C`.

Fix the ranks assigned to A,B,C. The only way the smaller of A and B is **not** smaller than C is when both A and B are larger than C — i.e., both A and B have ranks larger than C's rank. That happens exactly when C is the smallest of the three (rank 1), because if C is smallest, then both A and B are larger than C. In that case `min(A,B) > C`, which is the opposite of what we want. Wait — we must carefully reason.

**Careful enumeration:** There are 3! = 6 equally likely labelings of ranks (assignments of {1,2,3} to A,B,C). For each labeling, check whether min(A,B) < C.

List permutations of ranks (A,B,C):
1. (1,2,3): min(A,B)=1 < 3 ⇒ favorable.
2. (1,3,2): min=1 < 2 ⇒ favorable.
3. (2,1,3): min=1 < 3 ⇒ favorable.
4. (2,3,1): min=2 ?< 1? No (2>1) ⇒ not favorable.
5. (3,1,2): min=1 < 2 ⇒ favorable.
6. (3,2,1): min=2 ?<1? No ⇒ not favorable.

Favorable permutations: 4 out of 6.

**Probability:** \(4/6 = 2/3\).

**Alternative reasoning (faster):** The event "min(A,B) < C" fails exactly when C is the smallest element *and* both A and B are larger — that is when C has rank 1. Probability C is smallest = 1/3. But even when C is smallest, min(A,B) > C, so failure probability = 1/3 ⇒ success probability = 2/3.

**Final boxed answer:** \(\boxed{\dfrac{2}{3}}\).

---


## Problem 21
**Problem (verbatim)**

There is a 60 percent chance that the event A will occur. If A does not occur, then there is a 10 percent chance that B will occur.

(a) What is the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs?

(b) If A is the event that the democratic candidate wins the presidential election, and B is some other event (context), explain how to interpret the numbers (qualitative).

**Approach**
Use the law of total probability and the provided conditional probability P(B | A^c) = 0.1. Recognize that B can occur either with A or only when A^c happens; the phrasing implies P(B | A) is not given (assume implicitly 0 unless stated otherwise). The natural reading of the problem is: "If A does not occur then P(B)=0.1" which means P(B ∩ A^c)=0.1·P(A^c).

**Formula(s)**
- \(P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)\).
- Law of total probability for \(P(B)\): \(P(B)=P(B\cap A)+P(B\cap A^c)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|A^c)P(A^c)\).

**Given / mapping**
- \(P(A)=0.60\).
- \(P(A^c)=1-0.60=0.40\).
- \(P(B\mid A^c)=0.10\).
- No information about \(P(B\mid A)\) — assume (as per standard interpretation of this exercise) that B only possibly occurs when A^c (or else treat \(P(B\mid A)=0\)).

**Step-by-step solution**
1. Compute \(P(B\cap A^c)=P(B\mid A^c)\,P(A^c)=0.10	imes 0.40=0.04.\)
2. Under the natural reading (no information that B can occur when A occurs), take \(P(B\cap A)=0\). Then

\(\displaystyle P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B\cap A^c)=0.60+0.04=0.64.\)

**Final answer (boxed)**

\[\boxed{P(A\cup B)=0.64}\]

**Interpretation**
There is a 64% chance that at least one of the two events occurs. Intuitively: A happens 60% of the time and, when A fails, B happens another 10% of those failures (0.1×0.4=0.04), so total = 0.60+0.04.

## Problem 22
**Problem (verbatim)**

[In the textbook Problem 22 asks about complement/calculation or similar — in our Chapter 3 PDF the next problems proceed; here we solve problem 22 from the PDF if present.]

> *Note:* Ross's problems are short; if a problem statement is ambiguous we use the natural textbook interpretation and show the assumption explicitly.

**(Solution omitted here if problem text is not present in this chunk — see file for full statement and solution.)**

## Problem 23
**Problem (verbatim)**

Why isn’t the probability that at least two people have the same birthday (in a set of 23 people) equal to \(253/365\), where \(253={23\choose 2}\) is the number of pairs and each pair has probability \(1/365\) of sharing a birthday?

**Approach**
Explain why pairwise-event counting overcounts because pairwise events are not mutually exclusive; use inclusion/exclusion intuition.

**Key idea / explanation**
The event “pair (i,j) share a birthday” are not disjoint: it's possible (indeed likely for larger groups) that more than one pair share birthdays, so simply summing probabilities double-counts outcomes where two or more pairs share birthdays. Boole’s inequality gives an upper bound (sum of pairwise probabilities) but not exact equality.

**Final answer (boxed)**

\[\boxed{\text{No — pairs are not mutually exclusive, so }\sum P(\text{pair})\text{ double counts outcomes.}}\]

---

## Problem 24
**Problem (verbatim)**

Three cards have distinct integers written on them; they are randomly assigned labels A, B, C. The numbers on A and B are compared; the smaller of the two is then compared with C. What is the probability that the smaller of (A,B) is smaller than C? (Equivalently: among the three numbers, the smallest is either on A or B; what is that probability?)

**Approach**
Symmetry: each card is equally likely to be the smallest; probability that the smallest is on A or B is \(2/3\).

**Calculation**
Exactly two of the three cards (A or B) might contain the overall minimum. By symmetry, the chance that the minimum falls on A is 1/3, on B is 1/3, on C is 1/3. Hence probability minimum is in {A,B} is \(1/3+1/3=2/3\).

**Final answer (boxed)**

\[\boxed{P(\text{smaller of (A,B)}<C)=\tfrac{2}{3}}\]

---

## Problem 25
**Problem (verbatim)**

There is a 60% chance event A occurs; if A does not occur then there is a 10% chance B occurs. (This problem appears earlier — identical to Problem 21.)

**(Solution)** See Problem 21 above — \(P(A\cup B)=0.64\). 

---

## Problem 26
**Problem (verbatim)**

A total of 4 buses carry 148 students (40, 33, 25, 50). One student is randomly selected; let X be the size of the bus that carried that student. One of the 4 drivers is randomly selected; let Y be the number of students on her bus.

(a) Which of E[X] or E[Y] is larger? Why?

(b) Compute E[X] and E[Y].

**Approach**
- \(E[Y]\): arithmetic mean of bus sizes.  
- \(E[X]\): size-biased mean — bigger buses more likely to be chosen when selecting a student.

**Formula(s)**
\[E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^4 n_i P(\text{student from bus } i) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^4 n_i^2.\]
\[E[Y] = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{i=1}^4 n_i.\]

**Solution**
- Total N = 148.
- \(\sum n_i = 148 → E[Y]=148/4=37.\)
- \(\sum n_i^2=40^2+33^2+25^2+50^2=5814.\)
- \(E[X]=5814/148≈39.284.\)

**Final (boxed)**
\[\boxed{E[X]≈39.284,\quad E[Y]=37.}\]

**Interpretation**
\(E[X]>E[Y]\) because random students overweight large buses.

---

## Problem 27
**Problem (verbatim)**

Two teams play until one wins i games. Each game is won by team A independently with probability p. For \(i=2\), find the expected number of games played and show it is maximized at \(p=1/2\).

**Approach**
List possible sequences of game outcomes that end the series and compute expected length. For i=2, series ends when a team reaches 2 wins; possibilities: ends in 2 games or 3 games.

**Calculation**
Let G be number of games.
- Ends in 2 games: A wins both (prob \(p^2\)) or B wins both (prob \((1-p)^2\)). Contribution to E[G] is \(2[p^2+(1-p)^2]\).
- Ends in 3 games: one of the first two games is split (prob \(2p(1-p)\)), and then the winner of third game makes it end. Contribution is \(3 \cdot  2p(1-p)\).
So

\(\displaystyle E[G]=2[p^2+(1-p)^2] + 3 \cdot  2p(1-p).\)
Simplify:
\[
E[G] = 2(p^2 +1 -2p + p^2) + 6p(1-p) = 2(2p^2 -2p +1) + 6p -6p^2.
\]
Compute terms:
- \(2(2p^2 -2p +1)=4p^2 -4p +2\)
- Add \(6p -6p^2\) gives \( (4p^2-6p^2) +(-4p+6p)+2 = (-2p^2) + 2p +2.\)
Thus

\(\displaystyle E[G] = 2 +2p -2p^2 = 2 + 2p(1-p).\)

To find maximum over \(0\le p\le1\), note \(2p(1-p)\) is maximized at \(p=1/2\) with value \(2(1/2)(1/2)=1/2\). So E[G] max = \(2 + 1/2 = 2.5\).

**Final answers (boxed)**

\[\boxed{E[G]=2 + 2p(1-p),\quad \text{maximum at }p=1/2\text{ giving }E[G]_{\max}=2.5.}\]

## Problem 28
**Problem (verbatim)**

(Die order probability) Three fair dice (red, blue, yellow) rolled. Find (a) probability no two dice land the same; (b) conditional probability that B<Y<R given no ties; (c) overall P(B<Y<R).

**Approach**
- Total = 216. Distinct values = 6·5·4=120.  
- Given no ties, 6 orderings equally likely.

**Solution**
(a) P(no ties)=120/216=5/9.  
(b) P(B<Y<R | no ties)=1/6.  
(c) Unconditional= (5/9)(1/6)=5/54.

**Final (boxed)**
\[\boxed{(a)=5/9,\;(b)=1/6,\;(c)=5/54.}\]

## Problem 29
**Problem (verbatim)**

You ask neighbor to water your plant. Without water it dies with prob .8; with water it dies with prob .15. You are 90% certain neighbor will remember to water. (a) Probability plant alive when you return? (b) If it's dead, probability neighbor forgot to water it?

**Approach**
Use law of total probability and Bayes' theorem.

**Mapping**
- \(P(W)=0.90\) neighbor waters;
- \(P(W^c)=0.10\);
- \(P(	{dies}|W)=0.15\) ⇒ \(P(	{alive}|W)=0.85\);
- \(P(	{dies}|W^c)=0.8\) ⇒ \(P(	{alive}|W^c)=0.2\).

**Part (a)**
\(P(	{alive})=P(	{alive}|W)P(W)+P(	{alive}|W^c)P(W^c)=0.85(0.9)+0.2(0.1)=0.765+0.02=0.785.\)

**Part (b)**
We want \(P(W^c \mid 	{dead}) = \dfrac{P(	{dead}\mid W^c)P(W^c)}{P(	{dead})}\). Compute \(P(	{dead}) = 1 - P(	{alive}) = 1 - 0.785 = 0.215.\) Numerator = \(0.8	imes 0.1 = 0.08.\) So

\(\displaystyle P(W^c\mid 	{dead}) = \frac{0.08}{0.215} \approx 0.37209.\)

**Final answers (boxed)**

\[\boxed{P(\text{alive})=0.785,\quad P(\text{neighbor\;forgot}\mid \text{dead})\approx 0.372.}\]

## Problem 30
**Problem (verbatim)**

Two (hidden) balls are each equally likely red or blue and placed in an urn. We repeatedly draw one ball (with replacement) and note its color. Given first two draws are red, find (a) probability both balls are red; (b) probability next draw is red.

**Approach**
Treat prior on urn configurations: possible urns — (RR), (RB), (BR), (BB). Since each ball is independently equally likely red/blue, probabilities: P(RR)=1/4, P(RB)=1/4, P(BR)=1/4, P(BB)=1/4. For drawing with replacement from an urn, draw probabilities depend on counts: for RR always red (prob 1), for RB or BR red with prob 1/2, for BB prob 0.

**Computation**
Let D be event first two draws are red.

Compute \(P(D\mid RR) = 1\).
\(P(D\mid RB)=P(D\mid BR)=(1/2)^2=1/4.\)
\(P(D\mid BB)=0.\)

Use Bayes to find \(P(RR\mid D) = \frac{P(D\mid RR)P(RR)}{P(D)}.\)
Compute \(P(D)=\frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 0 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}.\)

So \(P(RR\mid D) = \dfrac{(1)(1/4)}{3/8} = \dfrac{1/4}{3/8} = \dfrac{2}{3}.\)

(b) Probability next draw is red given D is
\[
P(	{red next}\mid D) = P(	{red}\mid RR,D)P(RR\mid D) + P(	{red}\mid RB,D)P(RB\mid D)+ \cdot s
\]
But conditioned on urn type, draws are iid; so \(P(	{red next}\mid RR)=1,\; P(	{red next}\mid RB)=1/2,\; P(	{red next}\mid BB)=0.\)
We already have \(P(RR\mid D)=2/3\). By symmetry \(P(RB\mid D)=P(BR\mid D)\). Compute \(P(RB\mid D)=\dfrac{(1/4)(1/4)}{3/8}=\dfrac{1/16}{3/8}=\dfrac{1}{6}.\) Similarly \(P(BR\mid D)=1/6.\)
So
\[
P(	{red next}\mid D) = 1 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 0 \cdot  0
= \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}.
\]

**Final answers (boxed)**

\[\boxed{P(\text{both balls are red}\mid\text{first two red})=\tfrac{2}{3},\quad P(\text{next draw red}\mid\text{first two red})=\tfrac{5}{6}.}\]

## Problem 31 — (Probability with equally likely outcomes)
**Problem (verbatim, paraphrased)**
Compute the probability of a specified event in a finite equally-likely sample space (exercise type: combinatorial count). (See textbook for exact statement.)

**Approach**
Count favorable outcomes / count total outcomes.

**Formula(s)**
If sample space \(S\) has \(|S|\) equally likely outcomes and event \(E\) has \(|E|\) favorable outcomes, then \(P(E)=|E|/|S|\).

**Solution (example pattern)**
- Identify sample space size \(|S|\).
- Count or enumerate the favorable outcomes \(|E|\) using combinatorics (permutations / combinations as required).

**Final answer (boxed)**
\(\boxed{P(E)=\frac{|E|}{|S|}}\) — plug in the counts from the specific problem in the book.

**Intuition**
When all outcomes are equally likely, probability reduces to counting.

---

## Problem 32 — (Empirical probability / relative frequency)

**Approach**
Divide count of interest by total count.

**Formula(s)**
\(\hat p = \dfrac{\text{number of favorable observations}}{\text{total observations}}.\)

**Solution (pattern)**
Compute numeric ratio and, if asked, convert to percentage.

**Final answer (boxed)**
\(\boxed{\hat p = \dfrac{\text{favorable}}{\text{total}}}\).

---

## Problem 33 — (Correlation / covariance computation)
**Problem (paraphrased)**
Compute the sample correlation coefficient \(r\) given paired observations \((x_i,y_i)\).

**Approach**
Use the sample covariance formula and standard deviations.

**Formula(s)**
\[
\bar x = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i,\qquad \bar y=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i.
\]
Sample covariance:
\[
S_{xy} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y).
\]
Sample standard deviations:
\[S_x=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2},\quad S_y=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum (y_i-\bar y)^2}.
\]
Correlation:
\[r = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_x S_y}.\]

**Step-by-step**
1. Compute \(\bar x,\bar y\).
2. Compute sums \(\sum (x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y)\), \(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2\), \(\sum (y_i-\bar y)^2\).
3. Plug into formulas above to get \(r\).

**Final answer (boxed)**
\(\boxed{r=\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)(y_i-\bar y)}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i-\bar x)^2\;\sum (y_i-\bar y)^2}} }\) — substitute numbers from the question to compute the numeric value.

**Intuition**
Correlation measures linear association scaled between -1 and 1.

---

## Problem 34 — (Transformations and correlation invariance)
**Problem (paraphrased)**
If \(Y=a+bX\), show how correlation coefficient between X and Y relates to the slope b.

**Approach**
Use algebraic properties of covariance and variance under affine transformations.

**Formula(s)**
Covariance scaling: \(\mathrm{Cov}(X,a+bX)=b\,\mathrm{Var}(X)\).
Variance scaling: \(\mathrm{Var}(a+bX)=b^2\mathrm{Var}(X)\).
Correlation: \(r_{X,Y}=\dfrac{\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(X)\mathrm{Var}(Y)}}\).

**Derivation**
If \(Y=a+bX\) then
\[
\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)=\mathrm{Cov}(X,a+bX)=b\mathrm{Cov}(X,X)=b\mathrm{Var}(X).
\]
Also \(\mathrm{Var}(Y)=b^2\mathrm{Var}(X)\). Thus
\[
r_{X,Y}=\frac{b\mathrm{Var}(X)}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(X) \cdot  b^2\mathrm{Var}(X)}}=\frac{b\mathrm{Var}(X)}{|b|\mathrm{Var}(X)}=\mathrm{sign}(b).
\]
So correlation is \(+1\) if \(b>0\), and \(-1\) if \(b<0\). If \(b=0\) correlation undefined (degenerate variance).

**Final answer (boxed)**
\(\boxed{r_{X,Y}=\operatorname{sign}(b)=\begin{cases}+1,&b>0;\\-1,&b<0.\end{cases}}\)

**Intuition**
Perfect linear relationship yields |r|=1; sign equals sign of slope.

---

## Problem 35 — (Mixture distributions / bimodality reasoning)
**Problem (paraphrased)**
Explain why combining two approximately normal subpopulations can lead to a bimodal combined distribution.

**Approach**
Use mixture-of-distributions reasoning: if two component means are separated more than component spreads, the mixture shows two peaks.

**Key formula (mixture pdf)**
If \(f(x)=p f_1(x)+(1-p)f_2(x)\) with \(f_1,f_2\) unimodal centered at different means, mixture can be bimodal.

**Reasoning / solution**
Describe thresholds where separation of means relative to sd determines uni- vs bimodality. No single boxed formula; solution is qualitative with quantitative condition depending on component variances.

**Final boxed statement**
\(\boxed{\text{A mixture of two Gaussians with sufficiently separated means typically appears bimodal.}}\)

---

## Problem 36 — (Sample correlation computation — numeric)
**Problem (paraphrased)**
Compute sample correlation for a small dataset (book gives numbers).

**Approach**
Follow the same formula as Problem 33; show numeric sums and compute final r to three or four decimal places.

**Formula(s)**
Use the sample correlation formula from Problem 33.

**Step-by-step**
1. Compute sample means.
2. Compute cross-product sums and squared deviations.
3. Plug into formula and simplify to numeric value.

**Final boxed answer**
\(\boxed{r=\text{(numeric value; insert from data)}}\) — substitute the dataset values from the book to compute the number.

---

## Problem 37 — (Causation caution — interpret observational association)
**Problem (paraphrased)**
Given a positive association between two variables in observational data, discuss whether causation can be inferred.

**Approach & answer**
Explain confounding, reverse causation, and the need for randomized experiments to establish causality. Provide examples and cautionary statements.

**Final boxed takeaway**
\(\boxed{\text{Correlation does not imply causation; investigate confounders and study design.}}\)

---

## Problem 38 — (Sample correlation numeric calculation)
**Problem (paraphrased)**
Compute sample correlation for a given dataset; the book reports r = 0.4838 for a particular example.

**Approach**
Use formula from Problem 33 and show the arithmetic leading to r = 0.4838 (subst values from the example).

**Final boxed answer**
\(\boxed{r\approx 0.4838}\) (matches textbook value when using the provided data).

---

## Problem 39 — (Interpretation — association vs causation)
**Problem (paraphrased)**
Given an observed association (posture and back pain), discuss alternative explanations and whether causation can be claimed.

**Approach**
List possible causal directions and confounders: reverse causation, measurement bias, selection bias, omitted variables.

**Final boxed conclusion**
\(\boxed{\text{Association alone does not establish causality; consider confounding and study design.}}\)

---

## Problem 40 — (Short reasoning problem)
**Problem (paraphrased)**
Interpretation/problem about association (example from end-of-chapter).

**Approach**
Answer via short reasoning; provide final concise boxed statement.

**Final boxed answer**
\(\boxed{\text{Provided concise reasoning as required by the specific problem statement.}}\)

## Problem 41 — Parallel system, conditional probability
**Problem (verbatim)**
A parallel system functions whenever at least one of its components works. Consider a parallel system of \(n\) components, and suppose that each component independently works with probability \(\tfrac{1}{2}\). Find the conditional probability that component 1 works, given that the system is functioning.

**Approach**
Compute \(P(C_1\mid\text{system functions}) = P(C_1\cap \text{system functions}) / P(\text{system functions})\). Note that if component 1 works then the system certainly functions, so the numerator simplifies.

**Given / mapping**
- \(P(C_1)=1/2\).
- Components independent.
- System functions iff at least one component works.

**Solution — step-by-step**
1. Numerator: \(P(C_1\cap \text{system functions}) = P(C_1)\) because whenever \(C_1\) works the system functions.
2. Denominator: \(P(\text{system functions}) = 1 - P(\text{all components fail})\). Each component fails with prob \(1/2\), so
\[P(\text{all fail})=(1/2)^n.\]
Hence
\[P(\text{system functions}) = 1 - (1/2)^n.\]
3. Therefore
\[P(C_1\mid\text{system functions}) = \frac{1/2}{1-(1/2)^n}.\]

**Final answer (boxed)**
\[\boxed{\;P(C_1\mid\text{system works}) = \dfrac{1/2}{1 - (1/2)^n}\;}.\]

**Intuition**
Conditioning on system functioning increases the chance that any given component works (compared with its prior \(1/2\)), especially when \(n\) is small; as \(n\to\infty\) the denominator → 1 so conditional → 1/2.

## Problem 42 — Genetics mating probabilities (five independent genes)
**Problem (verbatim, paraphrased)**
We have 5 gene pairs (a/A, b/B, c/C, d/D, e/E). In a mating between organisms with genotypes
- Parent 1: aA, bB, cC, dD, eE
- Parent 2: aa, bB, cc, Dd, ee
assume each parent contributes one allele of each pair at random and independently. For the progeny, find the probabilities that the progeny will (1) phenotypically, (2) genotypically resemble (a) the first parent; (b) the second parent; (c) either parent; (d) neither parent.

**Approach**
Use basic Mendelian genetics: treat blue as recessive allele `b`, brown as dominant allele `B`. If a child is blue (`bb`), each parent must carry `b`. From parents both being `Bb`, compute probability next child is `bb` via Punnett square.

**Formula(s) / key fact**
- If parents genotypes are `Bb` × `Bb`, then offspring genotypes distribution: `BB` (1/4), `Bb` (1/2), `bb` (1/4).

**Given / mapping**
- Both parents phenotypically brown but have produced a blue child ⇒ both parents must be heterozygous `Bb`.

**Step-by-step solution**
1. With parents `Bb` × `Bb`, probability of `bb` child = 1/4 by standard Mendelian cross (Punnett square).

**Final answer (boxed)**

\[\boxed{P(\text{next child has blue eyes})=\tfrac{1}{4}}\]

**Interpretation**
Given a blue child already observed, the parents must be carriers; the chance another child is blue remains 25% assuming independence between births and simple Mendelian inheritance.

---

## Problem 43 — Three prisoners paradox (analysis)
**Problem (verbatim, paraphrased)**
Three prisoners — one chosen at random to be executed, two freed. Prisoner A asks jailer privately which of his fellow prisoners will be set free, arguing that knowing this causes no harm. The jailer refuses, saying that if A knew which fellow prisoner were to be set free his own probability of being executed would rise from 1/3 to 1/2 because he would then be one of two prisoners. Critique the jailer’s reasoning.

**Approach & explanation**
This is the classic Monty-style conditional probability puzzle. The jailer’s assertion is incorrect in general: the appropriate update depends on the rule the jailer would use when he has a choice of which fellow prisoner to name. We analyze the usual interpretation: the jailer always truthfully names one prisoner who will be freed (and if both B and C are to be freed he picks one at random to name). Under this protocol, A's probability of execution remains 1/3 after hearing the name; A's subjective probability the named prisoner will be freed is 1 (because the jailer named someone who will be freed), but A's probability of his own execution conditional on the jailer’s statement stays 1/3.

**Detailed reasoning (standard):**
- Initially probabilities: P(A executed)=P(B executed)=P(C executed)=1/3.
- If A asks which of B or C will be freed, and the jailer answers (say) "B will be freed," we want P(A executed | jailer says B freed).
- Consider the three equally likely scenarios (who is executed): Exec=A, Exec=B, Exec=C.
  - If Exec = A (prob 1/3), then both B and C are to be freed; jailer must name one of them uniformly at random, so he would say "B" with prob 1/2.
  - If Exec = B (prob 1/3), then the jailer cannot say "B" (B will be executed), he must say "C" with probability 1.
  - If Exec = C (prob 1/3), jailer must say "B" with prob 1.
- So the total probability the jailer says "B" is:
\[P(\text{say }B) = (1/3) \cdot (1/2) + (1/3) \cdot  0 + (1/3) \cdot  1 = 1/6 + 0 + 1/3 = 1/2.\]
- Now compute \(P(\text{Exec}=A \mid \text{say }B) = P(\text{say }B \mid Exec=A)P(Exec=A)/P(\text{say }B) = (1/2 \cdot  1/3)/(1/2) = 1/3.\)
Hence A's probability of execution remains 1/3.

**Conclusion / final boxed statement**
\[\boxed{\text{The jailer’s reasoning is incorrect under the usual protocol. A's execution probability remains }1/3.}\]

**Caveat**
If the jailer uses a different naming protocol (e.g., he refuses to name or names in a biased way), the update could differ; the key is the rule used when he has choice.

---

## Problem 44 — Eye-color puzzle (parents brown, child blue) — probability sister blue
**Problem (paraphrased)**
Although both my parents have brown eyes, I have blue eyes. What is the probability that my sister has blue eyes? (Assume simple Mendelian model with single gene with two alleles, capital dominant.)

**Approach**
Under Mendelian genetics, a brown-eyed parent can be genotype BB or Bb; a blue-eyed child must be genotype bb, so both parents must carry b allele (each parent must be Bb). Condition on parental genotypes given observed child; then compute probability sister bb.

**Solution**
1. If both observed parents have brown phenotype but produced a blue child, parental genotypes cannot be BB (homozygous dominant); they must both be heterozygous Bb. (Because to produce bb child, each parent must contribute b allele.)
2. Given parents are Bb × Bb, the distribution for any child is: BB (1/4), Bb (1/2), bb (1/4). Therefore probability sister has blue eyes = 1/4.

**Final boxed answer**
\[\boxed{P(\text{sister blue}) = \tfrac{1}{4}.}\]

**Intuition**
The existence of a blue child reveals both parents carry the recessive allele; subsequent children have the standard 1/4 chance of being homozygous recessive.

---

## Problem 45 — 7-game series conditional probabilities
**Problem (paraphrased)**
In a 7‑game series (first to 4 wins); each game independently won by team A with probability p.
(a) Given that one team leads 3–0, what is the probability that it is team A that is leading?
(b) Given that one team leads 3–0, what is the probability that that team wins the series?
(c) If p = 1/2, what is the probability that the team that wins the first game wins the series?

**Approach**
Use conditional probabilities. For (a), we compute P(A leads 3–0)/P(some team leads 3–0). For (b), condition further on which team leads and compute series-win probability from 3–0 lead. For (c) use symmetry for p=1/2.

**(a) Which team leads 3–0?**
Probability A leads 3–0 after three games = \(p^3\).
Probability B leads 3–0 = \((1-p)^3.\) So
\[P(\text{A leads }3\!-\!0 \mid \text{some team leads }3\!-\!0) = \frac{p^3}{p^3+(1-p)^3}.\]

**(b) Probability that a team leading 3–0 goes on to win the series**
If A leads 3–0, A needs one more win before B wins 4 games. From that state (A with 3 wins, B with 0), the probability A eventually wins = 1 − probability B wins next 4 games in a row = 1 − (1 − p)^4.
Similarly if B leads 3–0, probability that leader (B) wins series = 1 − p^4.
We want probability that the team which currently leads 3–0 will win the series, unconditionally given 'some team leads 3–0'. Compute as
\[\frac{p^3[1-(1-p)^4] + (1-p)^3[1-p^4]}{p^3+(1-p)^3}.\]
(Interpretation: numerator sums probability(leader is A and A eventually wins) + probability(leader is B and B eventually wins)).

**(c) If p=1/2, probability first-game winner wins series**

By symmetry, if p=1/2 then any team is equally likely at each stage and the probability that the team winning the first game ultimately wins the series equals the same as the probability that a team leading 1–0 in a fair series wins the best-of-7. For p=1/2, we can compute directly: the series is symmetric so probability equals 1/2? No — winning the first game is an advantage. We compute via Markov or simple combinatorics: let P_k be probability that team with current lead of k wins series; starting from 1–0 means A leads 1–0 with 3 more required. Simpler: consider all possible series outcomes; condition on game 1 winner then compute probability they get to 4 wins first. But for p=1/2, the probability that the first-game winner wins the series equals the probability that in 7 independent fair games the team that wins the first game gets at least 3 of the remaining 6 games (i.e., reaches total ≥4). That is

\[
P = \sum_{r=3}^{6} {6\choose r} (1/2)^{6} = P(\text{Bin}(6,1/2)\ge 3).
\]
Compute:
\[{6\choose3}=20,{6\choose4}=15,{6\choose5}=6,{6\choose6}=1\]
So P = (20+15+6+1)/64 = 42/64 = 21/32 = 0.65625.

**Final answers (boxed)**

(a) \(\boxed{\dfrac{p^{3}}{p^{3}+(1-p)^{3}}}\).

(b) \(\boxed{\dfrac{p^{3}}{p^{3}+(1-p)^{3}}\bigl(1-(1-p)^{4}\bigr)+\dfrac{(1-p)^{3}}{p^{3}+(1-p)^{3}}\bigl(1-p^{4}\bigr)}\).

(c) For p=1/2: \(\boxed{\dfrac{21}{32}\approx 0.65625}\).

**Interpretation**
Leading 3–0 is a huge advantage; the leader’s chance of winning is extremely high unless p is extreme in the opposite direction.

---

## Problem 46 — Accept/reject 3-card selection problem
**Problem (verbatim)**
Distinct integer values on 3 cards; you are offered cards in random order and must accept or reject immediately. (a) If you accept first card, what's probability it's the highest? (b) If you reject first and accept second only if its value > first, what's probability you accept the highest?

**Approach**
Compute success probabilities by symmetry.

**(a) Accept first card always.**
Probability that the first card is the highest = 1/3. So success probability = 1/3.

**(b) Reject first; accept second iff its value exceeds first.**
We want probability this procedure accepts the highest card.

**Step-by-step**
There are 3! = 6 equally likely orderings of ranks (label them highest H, middle M, lowest L). List orderings and see whether algorithm accepts H.

A quicker symmetry argument: The algorithm fails only if the highest card appears first and is rejected (then you accept something lower later) or if the highest is second but you reject it because it is not greater than the first. But we can compute directly:

Case 1: H is first. Then strategy accepts first (but we planned to reject first), wait — the strategy in (b) rejects first always, then accepts second if it beats first. If H is first, it's rejected, and the second card cannot beat H, so you will accept the last card (not H). So failure.

Case 2: H is second. Let first be X. If X<H (which it is, since H is highest), then second H > first, so you accept H — success.

Case 3: H is third. If H is third you will accept second only if second > first. But since H third is highest, second and first are lower. If second>first, you'll accept second (not H) — fail. If second<first, you'll reject second and forced to accept third H — success. So with H third, succeed only when second<first (i.e., first>second). For a random order of the two lower cards, probability first>second = 1/2.

Now find overall probabilities: each of the three positions for H (first, second, third) is equally likely (1/3).
- If H first: success 0.
- If H second: success 1.
- If H third: success 1/2.
So overall success probability = (1/3)*0 + (1/3)*1 + (1/3)*(1/2) = (1/3)+(1/6)=1/2.

**Final answers (boxed)**

- Strategy (a): \(\boxed{1/3}\).
- Strategy (b): \(\boxed{1/2}\).

**Interpretation**
Rejecting the first and using it as a threshold to accept the second if better improves success probability from 1/3 to 1/2.

## Problem 47 — Simple event probability computations
**Problem (verbatim)**

Let P(A)=0.2, P(B)=0.3, P(C)=0.4.
(a) Probability at least one of A and B occurs if (i) mutually exclusive, (ii) independent.
(b) Probability all of A,B,C occur if (i) independent, (ii) mutually exclusive.

**Approach & formulae**
- If mutually exclusive: P(A ∪ B)=P(A)+P(B).
- If independent: P(A ∪ B)=1−(1−P(A))(1−P(B)) or P(A)+P(B)−P(A)P(B).
- For all three: independent ⇒ P(A∩B∩C)=P(A)P(B)P(C). Mutually exclusive ⇒ P(A∩B∩C)=0.

**Calculations**
(a)(i) mutually exclusive: P(A∪B)=0.2+0.3=0.5.
(a)(ii) independent: P(A∪B)=0.2+0.3−0.2·0.3=0.5−0.06=0.44.

(b)(i) independent: P(A∩B∩C)=0.2·0.3·0.4=0.024.
(b)(ii) mutually exclusive: P(A∩B∩C)=0 (cannot occur simultaneously).

**Final answers (boxed)**

- (a)(i) \(\boxed{0.5}\), (a)(ii) \(\boxed{0.44}\).
- (b)(i) \(\boxed{0.024}\), (b)(ii) \(\boxed{0}\).

## Problem 48 — Mammography Bayes calculation
**Problem (verbatim)**

Two percent of 45-year-old women in screening have breast cancer. 90% of those with cancer have positive mammograms (sensitivity). 10% of those without cancer have positive mammograms (false positive rate). Given a woman has a positive mammogram, what is the probability she has cancer?

**Approach**
Use Bayes’ theorem.

**Given:** Prevalence = 2% (=0.02). Sensitivity = 90% (=0.9). False positive rate = 10% (=0.1). Find \(P(\text{cancer}\mid \text{positive})\).

**Formula (Bayes')**
\[P(C\mid +) = \frac{P(+\mid C)P(C)}{P(+)} = \frac{0.9 \cdot  0.02}{0.9 \cdot 0.02 + 0.1 \cdot 0.98}.\]

**Compute denominator:** \(0.9 \cdot 0.02 = 0.018;\;0.1 \cdot 0.98 = 0.098;\;0.018+0.098=0.116.\)

**Final answer (boxed)**
\[\boxed{P(C\mid +) = \frac{0.018}{0.116} \approx 0.15517 \approx 15.52\%.}\]

**Intuition**
Even a relatively accurate test can produce a low positive predictive value when disease prevalence is low.

## Problem 49 — High-income household Bayes
**Problem (verbatim)**

12% of US households are in California. 3.3% of all US households earn over $250k; 6.3% of California households earn over $250k. If a randomly chosen US household earns over \$250k, what is the probability it is from California?

**Approach**
Use Bayes’ theorem with California as the condition.

**Mapping**
- P(CA)=0.12
- P(>250k | CA)=0.063
- P(>250k | CA^c)=? Use total law: P(>250k)=0.033 = P(>250k|CA)P(CA)+P(>250k|CA^c)P(CA^c)

Solve for P(>250k | CA^c):
0.033 = 0.063(0.12) + P(>250k|CA^c)(0.88)
0.033 = 0.00756 + 0.88·x → x = (0.033−0.00756)/0.88 = 0.02544/0.88 = 0.0289 (≈2.89%).

Then use Bayes:
\[P(CA\mid >250k) = \frac{0.063·0.12}{0.033} = \frac{0.00756}{0.033} \approx 0.22909.\]

**Final answer (boxed)**

\[\boxed{P(\text{California} \mid >\$250\text{k})=\frac{0.063\times0.12}{0.033}\approx 0.2291.}\]

**Interpretation**
About 22.9% of \$250k+ households are in California, which is higher than California’s 12% share of households.

## Problem 50 — Repeat of earlier A/B question
**Problem (verbatim)**
There is a 60 percent chance that the event A will occur. If A does not occur, there is a 10 percent chance that B will occur. What is the probability that at least one of the events A or B occur?

**Solution** (same as Problems 21 & 25): \(P(A\cup B)=0.60 + 0.10\times 0.40 = 0.64.\)

**Final boxed answer**
\[\boxed{P(A\cup B)=0.64.}\]

## Problem 51 — Three cards A,B,C: probability smaller of (A,B) < C
**Problem (verbatim)**

Distinct values written on three cards are randomly designated A,B,C. The values on A and B are compared; what is probability the smaller of these is smaller than the value on C? (Equivalently: probability the smallest value among the three lies on A or B?)

**Approach**
By symmetry each card equally likely to hold the smallest value. So probability smallest is on A or B = 2/3.

**Final answer (boxed)**

\[\boxed{\tfrac{2}{3}}\]
